# Microsoft CMMC Enclave - Business Case Template

## Executive Summary

The Microsoft CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) Enclave provides a comprehensive, compliant cloud environment specifically designed for Department of Defense (DoD) contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). This solution addresses critical business requirements for CMMC Level 2 certification while enabling secure collaboration and operational efficiency in the defense supply chain.

### Key Business Drivers
- **Mandatory CMMC Compliance**: DoD contractors must achieve CMMC certification to maintain contracts
- **CUI Data Protection**: Legal requirement to protect controlled unclassified information
- **Supply Chain Security**: Strengthening cybersecurity across the defense industrial base
- **Competitive Advantage**: CMMC certification as a differentiator in federal contracting
- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoiding contract loss and regulatory penalties

## Problem Statement

### Current State Challenges
1. **CMMC Certification Requirements**
   - Mandatory for DoD prime contractors by December 2025
   - Required for subcontractors by December 2026
   - No certification means no new DoD contracts
   - Risk of losing existing contracts during renewal

2. **CUI Data Handling Gaps**
   - Inadequate protection of controlled unclassified information
   - Manual classification processes prone to errors
   - Lack of automated data loss prevention
   - Insufficient audit trails for compliance

3. **Security Infrastructure Deficiencies**
   - Legacy systems unable to meet NIST SP 800-171 requirements
   - Inadequate network segmentation and access controls
   - Missing continuous monitoring capabilities
   - Insufficient incident response procedures

4. **Compliance and Audit Challenges**
   - Complex regulatory requirements across multiple frameworks
   - Manual compliance verification processes
   - Lack of automated evidence collection
   - High cost of compliance audits and assessments
