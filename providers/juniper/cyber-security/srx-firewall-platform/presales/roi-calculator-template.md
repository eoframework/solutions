## Benefits Quantification

### Threat Prevention Value

**Security Breach Cost Avoidance**
```python
def calculate_breach_prevention_value(deployment_size, current_incidents, prevention_rate):
    """Calculate annual value from prevented security breaches"""
    
    breach_costs = {
        'small': 2_000_000,    # Average cost per breach
        'medium': 4_000_000,   # Larger organization impact
        'large': 8_000_000     # Enterprise-scale impact
    }
    
    annual_breach_probability = {
        'small': 0.15,    # 15% chance per year
        'medium': 0.25,   # 25% chance per year  
        'large': 0.35     # 35% chance per year
    }
    
    prevented_cost = (breach_costs[deployment_size] * 
                     annual_breach_probability[deployment_size] * 
                     prevention_rate)
    
    return prevented_cost

# Example Calculations:
Small Deployment: $2M * 0.15 * 0.90 = $270,000 annually
Medium Deployment: $4M * 0.25 * 0.95 = $950,000 annually
Large Deployment: $8M * 0.35 * 0.98 = $2,744,000 annually
```

**Regulatory Compliance Value**
```python
def calculate_compliance_value(deployment_size, compliance_frameworks):
    """Calculate value from avoided regulatory fines and penalties"""
    
    fine_exposure = {
        'pci_dss': {'small': 100_000, 'medium': 250_000, 'large': 500_000},
        'hipaa': {'small': 500_000, 'medium': 1_000_000, 'large': 1_500_000},
        'gdpr': {'small': 1_000_000, 'medium': 5_000_000, 'large': 20_000_000},
        'sox': {'small': 250_000, 'medium': 1_000_000, 'large': 5_000_000}
    }
    
    compliance_improvement = 0.90  # 90% improvement in compliance posture
    annual_violation_probability = 0.10  # 10% chance without proper controls
    
    total_exposure = sum(fine_exposure[framework][deployment_size] 
                        for framework in compliance_frameworks)
    
    avoided_fines = (total_exposure * annual_violation_probability * 
                    compliance_improvement)
    
    return avoided_fines

# Example for Medium Deployment with PCI DSS + HIPAA:
# ($250K + $1M) * 0.10 * 0.90 = $112,500 annually
```

### Operational Efficiency Gains

**Security Management Time Savings**
```python
def calculate_management_savings(team_size, avg_salary, time_reduction):
    """Calculate savings from reduced security management overhead"""
    
    current_overhead = 0.70  # 70% of time on manual tasks
    improved_overhead = 0.25  # 25% after automation
    
    time_savings = current_overhead - improved_overhead  # 45% improvement
    annual_savings = team_size * avg_salary * time_savings
    
    return annual_savings

# Example Calculations:
Small Team (3 people @ $120K avg): 3 * $120,000 * 0.45 = $162,000
Medium Team (8 people @ $125K avg): 8 * $125,000 * 0.45 = $450,000
Large Team (15 people @ $130K avg): 15 * $130,000 * 0.45 = $877,500
```

**Incident Response Acceleration**
```python
def calculate_response_savings(monthly_incidents, avg_response_time_hours, 
                              improved_response_hours, hourly_business_cost):
    """Calculate savings from faster incident response"""
    
    time_saved_per_incident = avg_response_time_hours - improved_response_hours
    monthly_time_savings = monthly_incidents * time_saved_per_incident
    annual_time_savings = monthly_time_savings * 12
    
    # Business disruption cost savings
    business_continuity_value = annual_time_savings * hourly_business_cost
    
    # Security team productivity savings  
    team_productivity_value = annual_time_savings * 150  # $150/hour blended rate
    
    return business_continuity_value + team_productivity_value

# Example for Medium Deployment:
# 75 incidents/month, 12 hours avg -> 2 hours improved
# (75 * 10 hours * 12 months) * ($10K/hour + $150/hour) = $91,350,000
```

### Business Continuity Value

**Uptime and Availability Improvement**
```yaml
Availability Metrics:
  Current State: 99.5% (43.8 hours downtime/year)
  Improved State: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
  Improvement: 35 hours additional uptime

Business Impact:
  Revenue per Hour: $50K-$500K (varies by organization)
  Productivity Cost: $25K-$100K per hour
  Customer Impact: $10K-$50K per hour reputation cost

Annual Value Calculation:
  Small Business: 35 hours * $75K/hour = $2,625,000
  Medium Business: 35 hours * $200K/hour = $7,000,000
  Large Enterprise: 35 hours * $400K/hour = $14,000,000
```
