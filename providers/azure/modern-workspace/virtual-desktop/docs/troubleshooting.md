# Azure Virtual Desktop Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Connection Issues

### Users Cannot Connect to AVD
**Symptoms**: Connection failures, authentication errors
**Causes**: 
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication problems
- Resource unavailability

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Verify user has proper AVD access permissions
2. Check Azure AD authentication and MFA settings
3. Validate network connectivity and DNS resolution
4. Review session host availability and capacity
5. Check Azure Virtual Desktop service health

### Slow Performance or Timeouts
**Symptoms**: Sluggish response, application timeouts
**Causes**:
- Network latency or bandwidth issues
- Resource contention on session hosts
- Storage performance bottlenecks

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Test network connectivity and latency
2. Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage on session hosts
3. Check storage performance metrics
4. Review concurrent user load
5. Scale resources if needed

## FSLogix Profile Issues

### Profile Loading Failures
**Symptoms**: Long login times, profile errors
**Resolution**:
1. Check FSLogix service status
2. Verify file share permissions and connectivity
3. Review FSLogix event logs
4. Test storage account access and performance
5. Check profile container sizes and limits

### Profile Corruption
**Symptoms**: Missing user settings, application errors
**Resolution**:
1. Restore profile from backup
2. Reset user profile if necessary
3. Check disk space and storage health
4. Review FSLogix configuration settings

## Session Host Problems

### VM Registration Issues
**Symptoms**: Session hosts not appearing in host pool
**Resolution**:
1. Verify Azure Virtual Desktop agent installation
2. Check network connectivity to AVD endpoints
3. Review VM system logs
4. Re-register session host if needed

### Auto-scaling Not Working
**Symptoms**: VMs not scaling based on demand
**Resolution**:
1. Check auto-scale configuration settings
2. Verify scaling triggers and thresholds
3. Review Azure Monitor metrics
4. Check VM scale set health status

## Authentication and Access Issues

### Single Sign-On Problems
**Symptoms**: Multiple authentication prompts
**Resolution**:
1. Check Azure AD Connect synchronization
2. Review conditional access policies
3. Validate certificate configuration
4. Test user authentication flow

### Permission Denied Errors
**Symptoms**: Access denied to resources or applications
**Resolution**:
1. Review RBAC assignments
2. Check application group memberships
3. Verify local permissions on session hosts
4. Review security group assignments

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Key Performance Counters
- Session Host CPU and Memory utilization
- Network bandwidth usage
- Storage IOPS and latency
- User logon time metrics

### Important Log Sources
- Azure Virtual Desktop logs in Log Analytics
- Windows Event Logs on session hosts
- FSLogix operational logs
- Azure Activity Log

### Diagnostic Tools
- Azure Virtual Desktop Insights
- Log Analytics queries
- Network connectivity tests
- Performance monitoring dashboards

## Emergency Procedures

### Service Outage Response
1. Check Azure Service Health dashboard
2. Activate backup session hosts if available
3. Communicate with users about service status
4. Implement temporary workarounds
5. Document incident for post-mortem analysis
