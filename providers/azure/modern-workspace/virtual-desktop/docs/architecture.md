# Azure Virtual Desktop Architecture

## Solution Architecture Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for the Azure Virtual Desktop solution, including core components, network topology, and integration patterns.

## Core Components

### Control Plane
- **Azure Virtual Desktop Service**: Microsoft-managed control plane
- **Workspace and Application Groups**: Logical grouping of resources
- **Host Pools**: Collections of session host VMs

### Session Hosts
- **Windows 11 Multi-session VMs**: Primary compute resources
- **VM Scale Sets**: Auto-scaling infrastructure
- **Custom Images**: Standardized Windows images with applications

### Identity and Access
- **Azure Active Directory**: Identity provider and authentication
- **Conditional Access**: Security policies and access controls
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for administration

### Storage and Profiles
- **FSLogix Profile Containers**: User profile virtualization
- **Azure Files/NetApp**: Profile storage backend
- **Storage Accounts**: File shares and application data

### Networking
- **Virtual Networks**: Network isolation and connectivity
- **Network Security Groups**: Traffic filtering and security
- **Azure Bastion/VPN**: Secure administrative access

```

## Network Flow
1. User authentication through Azure AD
2. Resource enumeration from AVD workspace
3. Connection brokering to available session host
4. Profile loading from FSLogix containers
5. Application and desktop delivery

## Security Considerations
- Network segmentation and NSG rules
- Identity-based access controls
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Conditional access policies
- Monitoring and audit logging

## Scalability and Performance
- Auto-scaling based on user load
- Load balancing across session hosts
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Resource allocation and sizing guidelines
