# Troubleshooting Guide - GitHub Actions Enterprise CI/CD Platform

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Workflow Execution Failures and Runner Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Workflows failing with "No runner available" errors
- Jobs queued indefinitely without execution
- Self-hosted runners showing offline or disconnected status
- Inconsistent workflow execution times and performance

**Causes:**
- Insufficient runner capacity for concurrent job execution
- Network connectivity issues between runners and GitHub services
- Runner authentication token expiration or permission issues
- Self-hosted runner configuration or service problems
- Resource constraints on runner machines (CPU, memory, disk space)

**Solutions:**
1. Scale runner infrastructure to meet concurrent job demand
2. Verify network connectivity and firewall rules for GitHub API endpoints
3. Regenerate runner tokens and restart runner services
4. Monitor runner resource utilization and upgrade hardware if needed
5. Implement runner auto-scaling based on job queue depth

### Issue 2: Authentication and Permission Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Workflows failing with "Permission denied" or authentication errors
- Unable to access secrets or environment variables
- Cloud deployment failures due to credential issues
- Package publishing or pulling failures

**Causes:**
- Incorrect or expired personal access tokens (PAT)
- Insufficient repository or organization permissions
- OIDC configuration issues for cloud platform authentication
- Secrets not properly configured or scoped
- Branch protection rules blocking required operations

**Solutions:**
1. Regenerate PATs with appropriate scopes and update secrets
2. Review and adjust repository and organization permission settings
3. Configure OIDC trust relationships for cloud platform access
4. Verify secret configuration and access permissions
5. Update branch protection rules to allow necessary automated operations

### Issue 3: Build and Deployment Pipeline Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Build failures due to dependency or compilation errors
- Test failures causing pipeline to halt
- Deployment timeouts or connection failures
- Artifact publishing or retrieval failures

**Causes:**
- Dependency version conflicts or availability issues
- Test environment configuration problems
- Network connectivity issues to deployment targets
- Insufficient permissions for deployment operations
- Resource constraints in target environments

**Solutions:**
1. Pin dependency versions and use lock files for consistency
2. Configure proper test environments with required services
3. Validate network connectivity and firewall rules for deployment targets
4. Ensure deployment service accounts have necessary permissions
5. Monitor and scale target environment resources appropriately

### Issue 4: Security Scanning and Code Quality Issues
**Symptoms:**
- CodeQL analysis failures or timeout errors
- False positive security alerts blocking workflows
- Dependency scanning showing vulnerabilities in approved packages
- Secret scanning generating excessive alerts

**Causes:**
- Large codebases exceeding CodeQL analysis time limits
- Overly sensitive security scanning configuration
- Outdated vulnerability databases causing false positives
- Legitimate secrets being flagged due to pattern matching
- Missing baseline configuration for security tools

**Solutions:**
1. Optimize CodeQL configuration and exclude unnecessary files
2. Create allowlists for approved security exceptions
3. Update vulnerability databases and review alert configurations
4. Implement proper secret patterns and exclusion rules
5. Establish security baselines and approval workflows

### Issue 5: Performance and Scalability Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Slow workflow execution times and poor performance
- Concurrent job limits being reached frequently
- High costs due to inefficient resource usage
- Workflow timeouts during peak usage periods

**Causes:**
- Inefficient workflow design with unnecessary steps
- Lack of build caching and artifact reuse
- Insufficient concurrent job limits for organization needs
- Poor resource allocation and runner sizing
- Absence of workflow optimization and monitoring

**Solutions:**
1. Implement build caching and artifact reuse strategies
2. Optimize workflow design to eliminate redundant operations
3. Increase concurrent job limits or implement job queuing
4. Right-size runners based on workload characteristics
5. Monitor workflow performance and implement optimization recommendations

## Diagnostic Tools

### Built-in GitHub Tools
- **Actions Tab**: Workflow run history, logs, and execution details
- **Insights**: Repository activity, workflow performance, and usage analytics
- **Security Tab**: Security alerts, vulnerability reports, and scanning results
- **Settings**: Organization and repository configuration and permission management
- **API**: GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs for programmatic access to data

### GitHub CLI Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check workflow status and recent runs
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit=10

# View detailed workflow run information
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Check repository settings and permissions
gh repo view --json permissions,visibility

# List and manage secrets
gh secret list
gh secret set SECRET_NAME --body "secret_value"

# Monitor runner status
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners

# Check rate limits and API usage
gh api rate_limit
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Debugging
```yaml
# Enable debug logging in workflows
name: Debug Workflow
on: [push]

env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true

jobs:
  debug:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Debug Information
      run: |
        echo "Runner OS: $RUNNER_OS"
        echo "GitHub Context: ${{ toJson(github) }}"
        echo "Runner Context: ${{ toJson(runner) }}"
        echo "Job Context: ${{ toJson(job) }}"
    
    - name: Check Environment
      run: |
        env | sort
        df -h
        free -m
        cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l
```

### API-Based Monitoring Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Monitor workflow runs and performance

# Get organization workflow usage
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/orgs/$ORG/actions/billing/usage"

# Check runner status for repository
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/runners"

# Get workflow run statistics
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/runs?status=completed&per_page=100" \
  | jq '.workflow_runs[] | {id: .id, conclusion: .conclusion, run_time: (.updated_at | fromdateiso8601) - (.created_at | fromdateiso8601)}'
```

### External Monitoring Tools

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14, 16, 18]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    # Cache dependencies
    - name: Cache Node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

          ${{ runner.os }}-node-
    
    # Parallel test execution
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test -- --parallel --max-workers=4
```

### Build Optimization
```yaml
# Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Runner Performance Tuning

    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: |
        # Use temporary credentials from OIDC
        aws s3 sync ./build s3://${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET }}
```

### Dependency Security
