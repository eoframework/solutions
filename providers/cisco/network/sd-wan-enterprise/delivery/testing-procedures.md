# Testing Procedures - Cisco SD-WAN Enterprise

## Overview

This document outlines testing procedures for validating Cisco SD-WAN Enterprise deployments.

---

## Pre-Implementation Testing

### Infrastructure Validation
- [ ] WAN circuit connectivity
- [ ] Internet access validation
- [ ] DNS resolution testing
- [ ] Certificate installation
- [ ] Time synchronization

### Test Plan
1. **Control Plane Testing**
   - Controller registration
   - Certificate validation
   - Policy distribution
   - Failover scenarios

2. **Data Plane Testing**
   - Tunnel establishment
   - Application performance
   - QoS validation
   - Security policy testing

---

## Functional Testing

### Connectivity Tests
```bash
# Basic connectivity validation
ping 8.8.8.8 source 192.168.1.1
traceroute 8.8.8.8
telnet google.com 80
nslookup google.com
```

### Application Testing
| Application | Test Type | Expected Result |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS | Web browsing | <2 sec response |
| VoIP | Call quality | <150ms latency |
| Video | Conference call | <200ms jitter |
| File Transfer | Large files | >80% bandwidth |

---

## Performance Testing

### Bandwidth Testing
```bash
# iPerf bandwidth test
iperf3 -c 203.0.113.10 -t 60 -P 4
iperf3 -c 203.0.113.10 -u -b 100M -t 30
```

### Latency Testing
```bash
# Application-specific latency
ping -c 100 crm.company.com
hping3 -S -p 443 -c 100 app.company.com
```

---

## Security Testing

### Policy Validation
- Firewall rule testing
- Access control verification
- VPN tunnel encryption
- Traffic inspection

### Security Scenarios
1. **Blocked Traffic Test**
   - Attempt blocked connections
   - Verify logging
   - Test alert generation

2. **Intrusion Detection**
   - Simulate attacks
   - Verify detection
   - Test response actions

---

## Failover Testing

### WAN Failover
1. **Primary Circuit Failure**
   - Disconnect primary WAN
   - Verify traffic switchover
   - Measure convergence time
   - Test application continuity

2. **Controller Failover**
   - Shutdown primary controller
   - Verify secondary takeover
   - Test policy distribution
   - Validate data plane operation

---

## Load Testing

### Concurrent Users
```bash
# Simulate multiple users
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -o /dev/null -s http://app.company.com &
done
wait
```

### Stress Testing
- Maximum concurrent connections
- Peak bandwidth utilization
- Policy processing capacity
- Management scalability

---

## User Acceptance Testing

### Business Application Testing
| Application | User Group | Test Scenarios |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| ERP System | Finance | Order processing |
| CRM | Sales | Customer lookup |
| Email | All users | Send/receive |
| File Sharing | IT | Large file upload |

### Performance Criteria
- Application response time < 3 seconds
- File transfer speed > 10 Mbps
- Voice quality MOS > 4.0
- Video conference no packet loss
