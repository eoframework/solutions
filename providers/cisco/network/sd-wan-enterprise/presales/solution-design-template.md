```
Internet Cloud
      |
[vBond Orchestrator] ---- [vManage NMS]
      |                        |
[vSmart Controller] -----------|
      |
Branch Sites with vEdge/cEdge Routers

- **vSmart**: Policy and control orchestration
- **vBond**: Zero-touch provisioning and discovery

#### Data Plane
- **vEdge/cEdge**: Branch gateway routers
- **WAN Connectivity**: Internet, MPLS, LTE

## Network Design

### Connectivity Design
| Site Type | Primary WAN | Backup WAN | Bandwidth |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Headquarters | MPLS | Internet | 1 Gbps |
| Regional Office | Internet | LTE | 100 Mbps |
| Branch Office | Internet | LTE | 50 Mbps |
| Small Office | Internet | None | 25 Mbps |

### Routing Design
- **OSPF**: Internal routing protocol
- **BGP**: External routing for internet
- **Static Routes**: Backup connectivity
- **Policy-Based Routing**: Application-aware routing

### Security Design
- **Zone-Based Firewall**: Traffic segmentation
- **VPN**: Encrypted overlay tunnels
- **Application Inspection**: Deep packet inspection
- **Threat Intelligence**: Real-time threat feeds

## Component Specifications

### Hardware Requirements

#### Headquarters
- **Model**: ISR4451-X
- **Throughput**: 1 Gbps
- **WAN Interfaces**: 2x GigE
- **LAN Interfaces**: 4x GigE

#### Regional Offices
- **Model**: ISR4331
- **Throughput**: 100 Mbps
- **WAN Interfaces**: 2x GigE
- **LAN Interfaces**: 3x GigE

#### Branch Offices
- **Model**: ISR4321
- **Throughput**: 50 Mbps
- **WAN Interfaces**: 2x GigE
- **LAN Interfaces**: 2x GigE

### Software Licensing
- **DNA Advantage**: Enterprise-grade features
- **Security Licenses**: Firewall and threat protection
- **Cloud Management**: vManage licensing

## Policy Design

### Application Policies
| Application | Priority | Bandwidth | Action |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Voice/Video | High | Guaranteed 20% | Prefer MPLS |
| Business Apps | Medium | Up to 50% | Load Balance |
| Internet | Low | Best Effort | Prefer Internet |

### Security Policies
- **Inbound Traffic**: Default deny, explicit allow
- **Outbound Traffic**: Allow with inspection
- **Site-to-Site**: Encrypted tunnels required
- **Guest Network**: Isolated VLAN with limited access

### QoS Policies
- **Voice**: Strict priority, low latency
- **Video**: Guaranteed bandwidth
- **Business Data**: Assured forwarding
- **Best Effort**: Default class

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Weeks 1-4)
- Deploy vManage, vSmart, vBond controllers
- Configure cloud infrastructure
- Establish initial connectivity
- Test control plane functionality

### Phase 2: Pilot Deployment (Weeks 5-8)
- Deploy 2-3 pilot sites
- Configure policies and templates
- Test application performance
- Validate security policies

### Phase 3: Regional Rollout (Weeks 9-20)
- Deploy remaining sites in phases
- Monitor performance and adjust
- Train operations staff
- Document procedures

### Phase 4: Optimization (Weeks 21-24)
- Fine-tune policies and performance
- Complete knowledge transfer
- Establish ongoing support
- Project closeout

## Migration Strategy

### Cutover Approach
- **Parallel Operation**: Run SD-WAN alongside existing
- **Gradual Migration**: Move applications incrementally
- **Site-by-Site**: Complete each site before moving to next
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain existing connectivity during transition

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Connectivity**: Keep existing circuits during pilot
- **Testing Protocol**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Support Coverage**: 24/7 support during cutover
- **Communication Plan**: Regular updates to stakeholders

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring and Management
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Single pane of glass
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Performance and health alerts
- **Reporting**: Regular performance and utilization reports
- **Capacity Planning**: Growth and bandwidth monitoring

### Support Model
- **Tier 1**: Basic monitoring and incident response
- **Tier 2**: Advanced troubleshooting and configuration
- **Tier 3**: Escalation to vendor support
- **Documentation**: Runbooks and procedures

## Expected Benefits

### Performance Improvements
