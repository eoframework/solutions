## Phase 4: Production Rollout and Operations (Weeks 13-16)

### Week 13: Full User Deployment

**Production Rollout Strategy**
```yaml
Rollout Approach:
  Department-Based Rollout:
    Week 1: Core creative teams (50% of users)
    Week 2: Extended creative teams (25% of users)
    Week 3: Review and stakeholder teams (20% of users)
    Week 4: Support and administrative teams (5% of users)
  
  Geographic Rollout (for distributed teams):
    Phase 1: Primary headquarters location
    Phase 2: Major regional offices
    Phase 3: Smaller offices and remote users
    Phase 4: External partners and contractors
  
  Risk Mitigation:
    - Maintain existing systems in parallel for 2 weeks
    - Provide 24/7 support during rollout period
    - Implement rapid rollback procedures if needed
    - Continuous monitoring and performance validation
```
