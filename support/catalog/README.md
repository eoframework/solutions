# EO Framework™ Catalog System

This directory contains auto-generated catalog files that organize and index all solutions in the EO Framework™ Templates repository.

## Directory Structure

- `catalog.yml` - Master catalog index
- `categories/` - Category-specific catalogs
- `providers/` - Provider-specific catalogs  
- `schemas/` - JSON schemas for validation

## Auto-Generated Files

All files in this directory are automatically generated by the GitHub workflow when changes are pushed to the main branch. Do not edit these files manually.

The catalog generation process:
1. Scans all solution metadata.yml files
2. Generates organized catalog structures
3. Validates against schemas
4. Exports to JSON and CSV formats

## Usage

These catalogs are used by:
- EO Framework™ website for solution discovery
- CLI tools for template browsing
- Integration APIs for programmatic access
