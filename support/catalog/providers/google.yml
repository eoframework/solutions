        description: Secure cloud foundation with governance & controls
        long_description: 'Starting on Google Cloud without a proper foundation leads
          to security gaps, disorganized resources, and management challenges as usage
          grows. Teams need guardrails that prevent misconfigurations while allowing
          them to work independently. Building a secure, scalable cloud foundation
          requires understanding Google Cloud best practices and implementing many
          interconnected configurations.


          This solution implements Google Cloud''s enterprise foundation blueprint
          with security controls, networking, identity management, and governance
          policies. It creates organizational structure, sets up billing, configures
          logging and monitoring, and establishes policies that enforce security requirements.
          The landing zone provides teams with secure project environments while maintaining
          centralized oversight.

        description: Collaborative digital workspace for modern teams
        long_description: 'Organizations need collaboration tools that work seamlessly
          across email, documents, video conferencing, and messaging. Managing separate
          tools from different vendors creates complexity and poor user experience.
          Data ends up scattered across multiple systems, making it hard to find information
          and collaborate effectively.


          This solution deploys Google Workspace providing integrated email, calendar,
          documents, spreadsheets, presentations, video conferencing, and team chat.
          Users can collaborate in real-time on documents, schedule meetings easily,
          and find information across all tools with unified search. The solution
          includes admin controls, security policies, and integration with existing
          identity systems.
