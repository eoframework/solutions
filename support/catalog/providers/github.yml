        description: Enterprise CI/CD automation & workflow management
        long_description: 'Development teams need reliable CI/CD automation, but building
          and maintaining pipeline infrastructure diverts resources from feature development.
          Different teams often duplicate effort creating similar pipelines. Without
          standardization, pipelines become difficult to maintain and troubleshoot
          when issues occur.


          This solution establishes enterprise CI/CD using GitHub Actions with reusable
          workflows and organization-level policies. It provides pipeline templates
          for common scenarios, centralized secret management, and self-hosted runners
          for internal deployments. Teams get automated builds and deployments without
          managing infrastructure, while maintaining security and compliance controls.

        description: Advanced threat protection for code repositories
        long_description: 'Security vulnerabilities in code often go undetected until
          after deployment, when they become expensive to fix and may already be exploited.
          Manual code reviews miss subtle security issues, and separate security scanning
          tools create friction in the development process. Developers need security
          feedback early, when fixing issues is fastest and cheapest.


          This solution implements GitHub Advanced Security with CodeQL scanning integrated
          into development workflows. It automatically analyzes code for security
          vulnerabilities, detects secrets accidentally committed, and scans dependencies
          for known issues. Developers receive immediate feedback in pull requests,
          and security teams get visibility into risks across all repositories.
