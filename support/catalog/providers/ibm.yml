        description: Enterprise container platform for modern applications
        long_description: "Organizations adopting containers need a platform that\
          \ runs applications consistently across different environments\u2014data\
          \ center, cloud, and edge. Kubernetes alone requires significant expertise\
          \ and additional tools for logging, monitoring, networking, and security.\
          \ Development teams need self-service capabilities while operations teams\
          \ need control and visibility.\n\nThis solution deploys Red Hat OpenShift\
          \ on IBM Cloud as an enterprise Kubernetes platform. It adds developer tools,\
          \ integrated CI/CD, security policies, and operational capabilities on top\
          \ of Kubernetes. The platform provides a consistent runtime environment\
          \ across locations, includes built-in monitoring and logging, and gives\
          \ developers self-service application deployment with guardrails.\n"

        description: IT automation platform for operational efficiency
        long_description: 'IT operations teams manage thousands of servers, network
          devices, and cloud resources using manual procedures or custom scripts.
          This approach is error-prone, time-consuming, and doesn''t scale. Changes
          made manually are difficult to track, audit, and reverse when problems occur.
          Knowledge about how systems are configured exists in people''s heads rather
          than in documented, testable code.


          This solution implements Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to automate
          IT operations across infrastructure. It provides automation playbooks for
          common tasks, centralized execution and scheduling, and role-based access
          control. Teams can automate server configuration, application deployment,
          and routine maintenance tasks with auditable, version-controlled automation
          code. The solution reduces manual errors and frees IT staff for higher-value
          work.
