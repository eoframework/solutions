        description: GPU cluster for parallel computing & AI workloads
        long_description: 'Scientific computing, simulations, and data analytics workloads
          need parallel processing power that traditional CPU-based systems can''t
          provide efficiently. Setting up GPU computing requires expertise in hardware
          selection, driver configuration, and optimizing workloads to use GPUs effectively.
          Sharing GPU resources fairly among multiple users and jobs requires specialized
          cluster management.


          This solution creates an NVIDIA GPU compute cluster for parallel processing
          workloads. It includes GPU servers, job scheduling, resource management,
          and monitoring configured specifically for GPU computing. Users can submit
          jobs that automatically utilize available GPUs, and administrators can manage
          resources and track utilization across the cluster.

        description: High-performance computing for AI model training
        long_description: "Training large AI models requires massive computing power\
          \ and parallel processing across many GPUs. Building this infrastructure\
          \ with standard servers is complex, inefficient, and difficult to scale.\
          \ Organizations waste resources on suboptimal configurations and spend significant\
          \ time troubleshooting performance issues instead of focusing on AI research\
          \ and development.\n\nThis solution deploys NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2014a pre-designed\

          \ and AI software stack. It provides the computing power needed for large-scale\
          \ model training with validated architecture and configurations. The solution\
          \ eliminates guesswork in building AI infrastructure and delivers maximum\

        description: Real-time collaboration platform for 3D workflows
        long_description: 'Design and engineering teams working on 3D content face
          challenges collaborating when using different software tools. Large 3D files
          are difficult to share, reviewing designs requires specialized software,
          and real-time collaboration is nearly impossible. Teams waste time converting
          files between formats and coordinating changes across team members.


          This solution implements NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for real-time 3D collaboration
          and simulation. It connects different 3D tools and allows teams to work
          on the same project simultaneously regardless of the software they use.
          The solution provides physically accurate rendering, real-time visualization
          of changes, and centralized project management for 3D design workflows.
