        description: Complete Microsoft 365 enterprise deployment
        long_description: 'Organizations moving to Microsoft 365 face complexity in
          migrating email, enabling collaboration tools, and training users on new
          applications. Deployments often miss important configurations for security,
          compliance, and backup. Without proper planning, migrations disrupt users
          and businesses don''t realize the full value of Microsoft 365 capabilities.


          This solution provides a structured approach to deploy Microsoft 365 across
          the organization. It includes migration planning, email and data migration
          procedures, security baseline configurations, and user adoption materials.
          The solution covers Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and security
          features with templates and automation to accelerate deployment while maintaining
          security standards.

        description: CMMC-compliant secure enclave for defense contractors
        long_description: 'Defense contractors must comply with CMMC (Cybersecurity
          Maturity Model Certification) requirements to protect Controlled Unclassified
          Information (CUI). Meeting these requirements means implementing specific
          security controls, maintaining audit trails, and proving compliance. Building
          a compliant environment from scratch is complex and time-consuming without
          clear guidance on required configurations.


          This solution creates a secure enclave within Microsoft 365 and Azure that
          meets CMMC Level 2 requirements. It implements required security controls,
          configures audit logging, restricts data access, and provides compliance
          reporting. The enclave isolates CUI data and ensures only authorized users
          can access it through compliant methods.
