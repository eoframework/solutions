        description: Multi-cloud infrastructure management & automation
        long_description: 'Organizations using multiple cloud providers face the challenge
          of different APIs, tools, and workflows for each platform. Managing infrastructure
          requires cloud-specific expertise and creates dependencies on specific vendors.
          Deploying the same application across clouds requires building everything
          multiple times with provider-specific tools.


          This solution uses HashiCorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Vault) to create
          a consistent platform across cloud providers. It enables infrastructure-as-code
          that works across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with the same workflow. The
          solution provides unified service networking, secrets management, and infrastructure
          provisioning regardless of underlying cloud provider.

        description: Enterprise infrastructure as code platform
        long_description: 'Teams adopting infrastructure-as-code with Terraform need
          collaboration features, state management, and governance controls. Storing
          Terraform state locally or in basic storage risks conflicts, data loss,
          and security exposure of sensitive information. Without standardization,
          each team implements Terraform differently, making it hard to share modules
          and maintain consistency.


          This solution implements Terraform Enterprise to provide centralized state
          management, access controls, and policy enforcement for infrastructure-as-code.
          It enables team collaboration on Terraform code, provides approval workflows
          for changes, and integrates with VCS for version control. The solution includes
          module registry for sharing reusable code and compliance policies that automatically
          prevent violations.
