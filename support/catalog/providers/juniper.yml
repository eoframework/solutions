        description: AI-driven network operations & user experiences
        long_description: 'Wireless networks are critical infrastructure, but troubleshooting
          connectivity issues is time-consuming and reactive. Network teams receive
          vague complaints like "WiFi is slow" without tools to identify root causes
          quickly. Planning WiFi coverage requires specialized expertise, and changes
          made in one area can impact other locations unexpectedly.


          This solution uses Juniper Mist AI-driven wireless networking with machine
          learning to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues automatically.
          It provides real-time visibility into user experience, identifies problems
          before users report them, and recommends fixes. The solution simplifies
          WiFi planning with AI-powered coverage analysis and automates routine network
          operations.

        description: Next-gen firewall for enterprise network security
        long_description: 'Network security requires filtering traffic between network
          segments, inspecting for threats, and enforcing access policies. Traditional
          firewalls become bottlenecks as traffic grows and struggle to inspect encrypted
          traffic effectively. Managing firewall rules across multiple devices leads
          to configuration drift and security gaps.


          This solution deploys Juniper SRX firewalls providing high-performance network
          security for enterprise and data center environments. It handles firewall,
          VPN, intrusion prevention, and threat intelligence in a single platform.
          The solution scales from branch offices to large data centers, provides
          centralized management of policies, and includes threat intelligence feeds
          for detecting known malicious activity.
