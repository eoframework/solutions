        description: Smart document processing with Azure cognitive AI
        long_description: 'Businesses handle large volumes of forms and documents
          that require manual review and data entry. Processing insurance claims,
          loan applications, or customer onboarding forms ties up staff in repetitive
          tasks. Errors in manual processing lead to delays, rework, and compliance
          issues.


          This solution uses Azure AI Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer) to automatically
          extract data from structured and semi-structured documents. It processes
          forms, receipts, invoices, and identity documents, extracting key fields
          and validating data. The solution integrates with existing business processes
          and can handle high document volumes with consistent accuracy.

        description: Secure Azure foundation for enterprise workloads
        long_description: 'Organizations moving to Azure need a secure, well-organized
          cloud foundation that supports multiple teams and workloads. Without proper
          setup, environments become disorganized, security gaps emerge, and managing
          costs and compliance becomes difficult. Building this foundation from scratch
          requires deep Azure expertise and understanding of best practices.


          This solution implements Azure''s Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone architecture,
          providing a secure foundation for cloud operations. It sets up management
          groups, subscriptions, networking, identity, security controls, and governance
          policies. The landing zone gives teams self-service capabilities while maintaining
          centralized security and compliance controls.

        description: Global WAN connectivity for distributed enterprises
        long_description: 'Organizations with multiple offices, data centers, and
          cloud resources need reliable connectivity between all locations. Managing
          separate connections, routing, and security policies for each site is complex
          and expensive. Network performance issues impact user experience and application
          availability across distributed operations.


          This solution implements Azure Virtual WAN to create a unified global network
          connecting branches, data centers, and Azure regions. It provides optimized
          routing through Microsoft''s global network, centralized security policies,
          and simplified management of all connections. The solution reduces network
          latency and makes it easier to add new locations.

        description: DevOps platform for accelerated software delivery
        long_description: 'Development teams using disparate tools and manual processes
          struggle with slow deployment cycles, inconsistent environments, and difficulty
          tracking changes across projects. Teams waste time on repetitive tasks instead
          of delivering features. Without standardized pipelines, errors increase
          and getting code to production takes too long.


          This solution establishes an Azure DevOps platform with standardized CI/CD
          pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure-as-code templates. It provides
          project templates, branching strategies, and deployment workflows that teams
          can adopt immediately. The platform enforces quality gates, automates security
          scanning, and provides visibility into the entire delivery process.

        long_description: 'Remote and hybrid work requires secure access to corporate
          applications and desktops from any location. Traditional VPN solutions struggle
          with performance and user experience. Managing physical desktops or individual
          virtual machines for remote workers is expensive and difficult to scale

          This solution deploys Azure Virtual Desktop to provide managed Windows desktops
          and applications through the cloud. Users access their work environment
          from any device with a consistent experience. The solution handles session
          management, scaling based on demand, and integrates with existing identity
