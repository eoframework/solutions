        description: AI-driven network insights for optimized performance
        long_description: 'Network teams troubleshoot issues reactively, often discovering
          problems only after users complain. Identifying the root cause requires
          analyzing data from multiple network devices, correlating events, and understanding
          traffic patterns. Without visibility into network behavior, teams struggle
          to prevent issues or optimize performance.


          This solution uses Cisco AI-powered analytics to monitor network health,
          predict problems, and provide recommendations. It collects data from network
          devices, identifies anomalies, and alerts teams before issues impact users.
          The solution provides insights into application performance, security threats,
          and capacity planning needs across the network infrastructure.

        description: Seamless hybrid cloud infrastructure integration
        long_description: 'Organizations running workloads both on-premise and in
          the cloud need seamless connectivity and consistent management across environments.
          Managing separate infrastructure, security policies, and operational tools
          for each environment creates complexity and increases overhead. Applications
          that span both environments face performance and reliability challenges.


          This solution implements Cisco HyperFlex to create a unified hybrid infrastructure
          platform. It extends on-premise data center capabilities into the cloud
          with consistent networking, security, and management. The solution allows
          workloads to move between environments and provides centralized visibility
          and control across all infrastructure.

        solution_display_name: SD-WAN Enterprise
        description: Enterprise SD-WAN for optimized branch connectivity
        long_description: 'Branch offices traditionally require expensive MPLS circuits
          for connectivity to headquarters and cloud services. Managing individual
          configurations for each branch is time-consuming, and changes require site
          visits or complex remote procedures. Users experience poor performance when
          accessing cloud applications over backhauled connections through the data
          center.


          This solution deploys Cisco SD-WAN to connect branch offices using multiple
          internet connections instead of costly MPLS. It automatically routes traffic
          based on application requirements and network conditions, providing better
          performance and reliability. The solution centralizes management, allows
          policy changes across all branches simultaneously, and improves cloud application
          access with direct internet breakout.

        description: Network-aware CI/CD for infrastructure automation
        long_description: 'Network infrastructure changes often require manual configuration
          across multiple devices, leading to errors and slow deployment cycles. Teams
          struggle to track changes, roll back problematic updates, and maintain consistency
          across environments. Testing network changes in production is risky, but
          building separate test environments is expensive.


          This solution brings DevOps practices to network infrastructure using Cisco
          automation tools. It enables infrastructure-as-code for network configurations,
          automated testing of changes, and version-controlled network policies. Teams
          can deploy network changes through CI/CD pipelines with approval workflows,
          automated validation, and easy rollback capabilities.

        solution_display_name: Zero Trust Network Gateway
        description: Zero-trust network access for enhanced security
        long_description: 'Traditional network security assumes users inside the network
          perimeter are trusted, but remote work and cloud applications have eliminated
          clear perimeters. Users access applications from various devices and locations,
          making it difficult to verify identity and enforce security policies. Breaches
          often occur when attackers gain initial access and move laterally through
          the network.


          This solution implements zero-trust network access using Cisco security
          technologies. It verifies every access request regardless of location, enforces
          least-privilege access, and continuously validates user and device trust.
          The solution provides secure access to applications without exposing the
          entire network and logs all access for compliance and investigation.
