      "long_description": "Organizations running on-premise infrastructure face high maintenance costs, capacity constraints, and difficulty scaling to meet changing business needs. Migrating to the cloud is complex\u2014it requires assessing current workloads, planning the migration sequence, converting servers, and validating that applications work correctly in the new environment.\n\nThis solution provides a structured approach to migrate on-premise workloads to AWS. It includes discovery tools to inventory current systems, migration planning templates, and automation scripts for common migration patterns. The solution handles server migrations, database conversions, and application modernization while maintaining business continuity throughout the transition.\n",

      "long_description": "Web applications are critical to business operations, but outages due to hardware failures, regional disruptions, or disasters can cause significant revenue loss and customer impact. Traditional disaster recovery solutions are expensive to maintain and complex to test, often requiring duplicate infrastructure that sits idle until needed.\n\nThis solution implements automated disaster recovery for web applications using AWS services across multiple regions. It continuously replicates application data, maintains backup environments, and can failover automatically when primary systems become unavailable. The solution includes regular testing procedures to ensure recovery capabilities work when needed.\n",
