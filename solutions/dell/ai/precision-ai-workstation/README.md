# Precision AI Workstation

**Provider:** Dell
**Category:** AI
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

AI and machine learning development requires substantial computing power for training models and processing large datasets. Standard workstations lack the GPU performance and memory needed for this work, forcing teams to queue for shared resources or wait for cloud instances. This slows down experimentation and model development cycles.

This solution provides Dell Precision workstations configured specifically for AI development with professional-grade GPUs, high-memory configurations, and fast storage. These workstations give data scientists and ML engineers dedicated resources for model development without depending on shared infrastructure. The solution includes software configurations for popular AI frameworks and tools.
