description: Multi-factor authentication for secure access
long_description: 'Password-based authentication is vulnerable to phishing, credential
  theft, and brute force attacks. Managing passwords is difficult for users and help
  desk password resets consume significant support resources. Regulatory requirements
  increasingly demand multi-factor authentication, but deploying MFA across all applications
  is challenging.


  This solution implements Dell SafeID for multi-factor authentication across enterprise
  applications. It supports multiple authentication methods including hardware tokens,
  biometrics, and mobile apps. The solution integrates with existing identity systems,
  provides centralized policy management, and reduces password-related security risks
  and support costs.
