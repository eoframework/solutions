## Slide 3: Current State Analysis

### Password Security Crisis

```
Security Incidents (Annual):
├── Password-related breaches: 2-3 incidents
├── Average breach cost: $4.45M
├── Credential theft attempts: 15,000+
└── Compliance violations: 12 findings

Operational Burden:
├── Help desk password resets: 15,000 tickets
├── Account lockout incidents: 8,500
├── IT staff time consumed: 40-60%
└── User productivity loss: 12.2 hours/user
```

### Regulatory Pressure
- **NIST Guidelines** mandate MFA for privileged accounts
