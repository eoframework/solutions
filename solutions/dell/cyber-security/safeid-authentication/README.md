# Safeid Authentication

**Provider:** DELL | **Category:** Cyber Security | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Production Ready

## Solution Overview

Password-based authentication is vulnerable to phishing, credential theft, and brute force attacks. Managing passwords is difficult for users and help desk password resets consume significant support resources. Regulatory requirements increasingly demand multi-factor authentication, but deploying MFA across all applications is challenging.

This solution implements Dell SafeID for multi-factor authentication across enterprise applications. It supports multiple authentication methods including hardware tokens, biometrics, and mobile apps. The solution integrates with existing identity systems, provides centralized policy management, and reduces password-related security risks and support costs.
