description: Enterprise CI infrastructure on PowerEdge servers
long_description: 'Running CI/CD pipelines requires substantial computing resources
  for building code, running tests, and deploying applications. Cloud-based CI/CD
  can become expensive at scale, especially for organizations with frequent builds
  and large test suites. Teams need reliable infrastructure that can handle peak loads
  without delays in the development process.


  This solution provides Dell PowerEdge server infrastructure optimized for CI/CD
  workloads. It includes configurations for build servers, test environments, and
  artifact storage with capacity to handle multiple concurrent pipelines. The solution
  reduces CI/CD costs compared to cloud-only approaches while maintaining the automation
  and scalability teams need.
