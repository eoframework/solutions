**Provider:** Dell
**Category:** DevOps
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Running CI/CD pipelines requires substantial computing resources for building code, running tests, and deploying applications. Cloud-based CI/CD can become expensive at scale, especially for organizations with frequent builds and large test suites. Teams need reliable infrastructure that can handle peak loads without delays in the development process.

This solution provides Dell PowerEdge server infrastructure optimized for CI/CD workloads. It includes configurations for build servers, test environments, and artifact storage with capacity to handle multiple concurrent pipelines. The solution reduces CI/CD costs compared to cloud-only approaches while maintaining the automation and scalability teams need.
