## Best Practices

### Script Development Standards
```yaml
development_standards:
  coding_practices:
    - "Follow language-specific style guides"
    - "Include comprehensive error handling"
    - "Implement logging and debugging"
    - "Use version control for all scripts"
  
  documentation:
    - "Include inline comments and documentation"
    - "Provide usage examples and parameters"
    - "Document prerequisites and dependencies"
    - "Maintain change logs and version history"
  
  testing:
    - "Test scripts in isolated environments"
    - "Implement unit tests where applicable"
    - "Perform integration testing"
    - "Validate idempotency for configuration scripts"
  
  security:
    - "Secure credential management"
    - "Input validation and sanitization"
    - "Principle of least privilege"
    - "Audit logging and monitoring"
```

### Version Control and Management
```bash
# Git workflow for script management
git_workflow:
  - "Feature branch development"
  - "Code review process"
  - "Automated testing in CI/CD"
  - "Tagged releases for stable versions"

# Version control best practices
version_control:
  - "Meaningful commit messages"
  - "Atomic commits for single changes"
  - "Regular branch synchronization"
  - "Proper .gitignore configuration"
```

### Error Handling and Logging
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example error handling and logging

# Set up logging
LOG_FILE="/var/log/poweredge-automation.log"
exec 1> >(tee -a "$LOG_FILE")
exec 2> >(tee -a "$LOG_FILE" >&2)

# Error handling function
handle_error() {
    local line_number=$1
    local error_code=$2
    echo "ERROR: Line $line_number: Command exited with status $error_code" >&2
    echo "ERROR: $(date): Execution failed at line $line_number" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    exit "$error_code"
}

# Set error trap
trap 'handle_error ${LINENO} $?' ERR
set -e
set -o pipefail

# Example usage
echo "$(date): Starting PowerEdge automation script..."
# Script commands here...
echo "$(date): Script completed successfully"
```

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
```yaml
security_practices:
  credential_storage:
    - "Use encrypted credential stores (Ansible Vault, HashiCorp Vault)"
    - "Avoid hardcoded passwords in scripts"
    - "Implement credential rotation procedures"
    - "Use service accounts with minimal permissions"
  
  access_control:
    - "Implement role-based access to scripts"
    - "Audit script execution and access"
    - "Use SSH key-based authentication"
    - "Implement multi-factor authentication where possible"
  
  data_protection:
    - "Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest"
    - "Implement secure communication channels"
    - "Use signed and verified script downloads"
    - "Regular security scanning of script repositories"
```

### Secure Execution Environment
```bash
# Secure script execution example
#!/bin/bash
# Security-enhanced script template

# Set secure umask
umask 077

# Validate input parameters
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"
    if [[ ! "$input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$ ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Invalid input characters detected" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Check script integrity
verify_script_integrity() {
    if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        expected_hash="your_script_hash_here"
        actual_hash=$(sha256sum "$0" | cut -d' ' -f1)
        if [[ "$expected_hash" != "$actual_hash" ]]; then
            echo "ERROR: Script integrity check failed" >&2
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
}

# Verify execution environment
verify_environment() {
    if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]] && [[ -z "${ALLOW_ROOT_EXECUTION:-}" ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Script should not run as root" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Main execution
main() {
    verify_script_integrity
    verify_environment
    
    # Script logic here...
}

main "$@"
```

      - "Monitor and optimize network bandwidth usage"
```

### Debugging Tools and Techniques
```bash
# Debugging script template
#!/bin/bash
# Enable debugging options
set -x          # Print commands as executed
set -v          # Print shell input lines as read
set -e          # Exit on first error
set -o pipefail # Exit on pipe command failures

# Debug logging function
debug_log() {
    if [[ "${DEBUG:-0}" == "1" ]]; then
        echo "DEBUG: $(date): $*" >&2
    fi
}

# Performance monitoring
monitor_performance() {
    local start_time=$(date +%s)
    "$@"  # Execute command
    local end_time=$(date +%s)
    local duration=$((end_time - start_time))
    debug_log "Command execution time: ${duration}s"
}

# Example usage
debug_log "Starting script execution"
monitor_performance some_command_here
debug_log "Script execution completed"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Script Performance Best Practices
```yaml

    - "Minimize external command calls"
    - "Implement caching for repeated operations"
    - "Use parallel execution for independent tasks"
  
  resource_management:
    - "Monitor and limit memory usage"
    - "Implement cleanup procedures"
    - "Use streaming for large data processing"
    - "Optimize file I/O operations"
  
  network_optimization:
    - "Batch API calls when possible"
    - "Implement connection pooling"
    - "Use compression for data transfer"
    - "Minimize network round trips"
```

### Monitoring and Metrics
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Performance monitoring integration
performance_monitor() {
    local script_name="$1"
    local start_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    
    # Execute script with monitoring
    /usr/bin/time -v "$script_name" 2>&1 | while read -r line; do
        echo "PERF: $line" >&2
    done
    
    local end_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    local execution_time=$(echo "$end_time - $start_time" | bc)
    
    # Send metrics to monitoring system
    curl -X POST "http://prometheus.company.com:9091/metrics/job/script_execution" \
        -d "script_execution_time{script=\"$script_name\"} $execution_time"
}

# Usage example
performance_monitor "deploy-jenkins.sh"
```
