# VxRail Hyperconverged

**Provider:** Dell
**Category:** Cloud
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Organizations need scalable infrastructure that can grow with business demands without major forklift upgrades. Traditional infrastructure requires planning large capacity expansions months in advance and purchasing multiple components separately. This leads to either overprovisioning that wastes budget or underprovisioning that impacts performance.

This solution uses Dell VxRail hyperconverged architecture to provide infrastructure that scales incrementally by adding nodes as needed. Each node expands both compute and storage capacity proportionally. The solution handles configuration automatically, maintains performance as you scale, and provides predictable cost structure based on node count.
