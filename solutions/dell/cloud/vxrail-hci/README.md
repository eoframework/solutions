# VxRail HCI

**Provider:** Dell
**Category:** Cloud
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Traditional data center infrastructure requires separate servers, storage, and networking components that are complex to integrate, scale, and manage. Capacity planning is difficultâ€”organizations often overprovision to avoid outages or underprovision and face performance issues. Managing these separate systems requires specialized expertise and significant time.

This solution implements Dell VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure that combines compute, storage, and networking into a single system. It simplifies deployment with pre-configured nodes that can be added incrementally as needs grow. The solution provides integrated management, automated operations, and seamless integration with VMware for running virtualized workloads.
