# SRX Firewall Platform

**Provider:** Juniper
**Category:** Cyber Security
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Network security requires filtering traffic between network segments, inspecting for threats, and enforcing access policies. Traditional firewalls become bottlenecks as traffic grows and struggle to inspect encrypted traffic effectively. Managing firewall rules across multiple devices leads to configuration drift and security gaps.

This solution deploys Juniper SRX firewalls providing high-performance network security for enterprise and data center environments. It handles firewall, VPN, intrusion prevention, and threat intelligence in a single platform. The solution scales from branch offices to large data centers, provides centralized management of policies, and includes threat intelligence feeds for detecting known malicious activity.
