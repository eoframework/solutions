# Security Automation Scripts - GitHub Advanced Security Platform

## Overview
This directory contains security automation scripts for deploying and managing the GitHub Advanced Security Platform configurations and integrations.

## Script Categories

### Python Security Scripts (Primary)
- **security_automation.py**: Main GitHub Advanced Security API integration and automation
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for GitHub API and security integrations
- Handles: GitHub REST/GraphQL API calls, SIEM integrations, compliance reporting, advanced security workflows

### Bash Scripts (Secondary)
- **deploy.sh**: GitHub CLI-based configuration and setup automation
- Handles: GitHub CLI operations, environment setup, CI/CD pipeline integration, simple configuration tasks

**Note**: This solution uses Python as the primary automation method due to its superior GitHub API integration capabilities and security automation features. Bash provides complementary CLI-based operations. Other script types (Terraform, PowerShell, Ansible) were removed as they are not optimal for GitHub Advanced Security configuration, which is API-driven rather than infrastructure-based.
