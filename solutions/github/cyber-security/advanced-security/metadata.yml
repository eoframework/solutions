description: Advanced threat protection for code repositories
long_description: 'Security vulnerabilities in code often go undetected until after
  deployment, when they become expensive to fix and may already be exploited. Manual
  code reviews miss subtle security issues, and separate security scanning tools create
  friction in the development process. Developers need security feedback early, when
  fixing issues is fastest and cheapest.


  This solution implements GitHub Advanced Security with CodeQL scanning integrated
  into development workflows. It automatically analyzes code for security vulnerabilities,
  detects secrets accidentally committed, and scans dependencies for known issues.
  Developers receive immediate feedback in pull requests, and security teams get visibility
  into risks across all repositories.
