description: Enterprise CI/CD automation & workflow management
long_description: 'Development teams need reliable CI/CD automation, but building
  and maintaining pipeline infrastructure diverts resources from feature development.
  Different teams often duplicate effort creating similar pipelines. Without standardization,
  pipelines become difficult to maintain and troubleshoot when issues occur.


  This solution establishes enterprise CI/CD using GitHub Actions with reusable workflows
  and organization-level policies. It provides pipeline templates for common scenarios,
  centralized secret management, and self-hosted runners for internal deployments.
  Teams get automated builds and deployments without managing infrastructure, while
  maintaining security and compliance controls.
