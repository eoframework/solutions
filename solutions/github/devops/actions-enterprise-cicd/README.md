# GitHub Workflow Automation

**Provider:** GITHUB | **Category:** Devops | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Production Ready

## Solution Overview

Development teams need reliable CI/CD automation, but building and maintaining pipeline infrastructure diverts resources from feature development. Different teams often duplicate effort creating similar pipelines. Without standardization, pipelines become difficult to maintain and troubleshoot when issues occur.

This solution establishes enterprise CI/CD using GitHub Actions with reusable workflows and organization-level policies. It provides pipeline templates for common scenarios, centralized secret management, and self-hosted runners for internal deployments. Teams get automated builds and deployments without managing infrastructure, while maintaining security and compliance controls.

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |

| Lead Time | Hours instead of weeks |
| Recovery Time | Minutes instead of hours |
