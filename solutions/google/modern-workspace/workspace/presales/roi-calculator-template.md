## ROI Calculation Framework

### 1. Productivity Benefits

#### Email and Communication Efficiency
```python
# Current email management cost
current_email_management_cost = (
    (it_support_hours_monthly * 12) * (average_it_staff_salary / 2080) +
    annual_license_cost + 
    server_maintenance_cost
)

# Future email management with Google Workspace (80% reduction in IT effort)
future_email_management_cost = (
    workspace_business_standard +
    ((it_support_hours_monthly * 0.20 * 12) * (average_it_staff_salary / 2080))
)

# Annual savings
email_management_savings = current_email_management_cost - future_email_management_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Current email cost: (800×12)×$45.67 + $1.44M + $240K = **$2.12M/year**
- Future email cost: $8.64M + (160×12)×$45.67 = **$8.73M/year**
- **Annual savings: -$6.61M** (Investment in better platform)

#### User Productivity Gains
```python
# Time savings per user from improved collaboration
time_savings_hours_per_user_per_year = 40  # Conservative estimate
productivity_value_per_hour = average_knowledge_worker_salary / 2080

# Total productivity benefit
user_productivity_benefit = (
    knowledge_workers * 
    time_savings_hours_per_user_per_year * 
    productivity_value_per_hour
)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Productivity value: 12,000 × 40 hours × $40.87/hour = **$19.6M/year**
- **Major productivity benefit from collaboration improvements**

#### Meeting and Collaboration Efficiency  
```python
# Meeting efficiency improvements
meeting_time_savings_percentage = 0.25  # 25% more efficient meetings
total_meeting_hours_annual = knowledge_workers * 8 * 52  # 8 hours/week
meeting_efficiency_benefit = (
    total_meeting_hours_annual * 
    meeting_time_savings_percentage * 
    productivity_value_per_hour
)

# Reduced meeting room and travel costs
travel_reduction = travel_budget_annual * 0.30  # 30% travel reduction
meeting_room_efficiency = meeting_room_annual_cost * 0.20  # 20% room cost reduction
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Meeting efficiency: 4.99M hours × 0.25 × $40.87 = **$50.9M/year**
- Travel reduction: $2.4M × 0.30 = **$720K/year**
- Meeting room savings: $450K × 0.20 = **$90K/year**

### 2. IT Cost Reductions

#### Infrastructure Cost Savings
```python
# Email server infrastructure elimination
email_server_elimination_savings = server_maintenance_cost

# File server and storage cost reduction
current_file_storage_cost = annual_storage_cost + sync_license_cost
future_storage_cost = additional_storage_cost  # Google provides 2TB/user
file_storage_savings = current_file_storage_cost - future_storage_cost

# Communication system consolidation
current_communication_cost = annual_meeting_cost + phone_system_cost
future_communication_cost = 0  # Included in Workspace
communication_savings = current_communication_cost - future_communication_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Server elimination: **$240K/year**
- File storage savings: ($150K + $180K) - $60K = **$270K/year**
- Communication savings: $240K + $360K = **$600K/year**

#### IT Support Efficiency
```python
# Reduced IT support requirements
current_it_support_hours_monthly = it_support_hours_monthly + 200  # Email + files
future_it_support_hours_monthly = current_it_support_hours_monthly * 0.35  # 65% reduction
it_support_cost_reduction = (
    (current_it_support_hours_monthly - future_it_support_hours_monthly) * 
    12 * (average_it_staff_salary / 2080)
)

# Reduced downtime costs
current_downtime_cost = (
    email_downtime_hours_annual * knowledge_workers * productivity_value_per_hour
)
future_downtime_cost = current_downtime_cost * 0.10  # 90% reduction with SLA
downtime_cost_savings = current_downtime_cost - future_downtime_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- IT support reduction: (1000-350) × 12 × $45.67 = **$356K/year**
- Downtime cost savings: (24×12,000×$40.87) - (2.4×12,000×$40.87) = **$10.6M/year**

### 3. Business Agility and Growth

#### Remote Work Enablement
```python
# Office space cost avoidance
office_cost_per_employee_annual = 12000  # Rent, utilities, facilities
remote_workers = employee_count * remote_workers_percentage
office_space_avoidance = remote_workers * office_cost_per_employee_annual * 0.50  # 50% space reduction

# Talent acquisition benefits (wider talent pool)
talent_acquisition_benefit = employee_count * 0.02 * average_knowledge_worker_salary  # 2% better hiring

# Employee retention improvement
retention_cost_avoidance = knowledge_workers * 0.05 * average_knowledge_worker_salary  # 5% better retention
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Office space avoidance: 6,000 × $12K × 0.50 = **$36M/year**
- Talent acquisition benefit: 15,000 × 0.02 × $85K = **$25.5M/year**
- Retention improvement: 12,000 × 0.05 × $85K = **$51M/year**

#### Innovation and Speed to Market
```python
# Faster project collaboration and execution
project_acceleration_benefit = annual_revenue * 0.015  # 1.5% revenue acceleration
faster_decision_making_benefit = annual_revenue * 0.005  # 0.5% from faster decisions

# New business model enablement
digital_transformation_value = annual_revenue * 0.01  # 1% from digital capabilities
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Project acceleration: $2.5B × 0.015 = **$37.5M/year**
- Faster decisions: $2.5B × 0.005 = **$12.5M/year**
- Digital transformation: $2.5B × 0.01 = **$25M/year**

### 4. Security and Compliance Benefits

#### Enhanced Security Posture
```python
# Avoided security incidents
security_incident_cost_avoidance = 50000 * 2  # Avoid 2 incidents per year at $50K each
compliance_audit_savings = 100000  # Automated compliance reporting

# Data loss prevention benefits
data_protection_value = annual_revenue * 0.001  # 0.1% of revenue protected
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Security incidents avoided: **$100K/year**
- Compliance savings: **$100K/year**
- Data protection value: $2.5B × 0.001 = **$2.5M/year**
