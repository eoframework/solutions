# Workspace

**Provider:** Google
**Category:** Modern Workspace
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Organizations need collaboration tools that work seamlessly across email, documents, video conferencing, and messaging. Managing separate tools from different vendors creates complexity and poor user experience. Data ends up scattered across multiple systems, making it hard to find information and collaborate effectively.

This solution deploys Google Workspace providing integrated email, calendar, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, video conferencing, and team chat. Users can collaborate in real-time on documents, schedule meetings easily, and find information across all tools with unified search. The solution includes admin controls, security policies, and integration with existing identity systems.
