# Landing Zone

**Provider:** Google
**Category:** Cloud
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Starting on Google Cloud without a proper foundation leads to security gaps, disorganized resources, and management challenges as usage grows. Teams need guardrails that prevent misconfigurations while allowing them to work independently. Building a secure, scalable cloud foundation requires understanding Google Cloud best practices and implementing many interconnected configurations.

This solution implements Google Cloud's enterprise foundation blueprint with security controls, networking, identity management, and governance policies. It creates organizational structure, sets up billing, configures logging and monitoring, and establishes policies that enforce security requirements. The landing zone provides teams with secure project environments while maintaining centralized oversight.
