description: Secure cloud foundation with governance & controls
long_description: 'Starting on Google Cloud without a proper foundation leads to security
  gaps, disorganized resources, and management challenges as usage grows. Teams need
  guardrails that prevent misconfigurations while allowing them to work independently.
  Building a secure, scalable cloud foundation requires understanding Google Cloud
  best practices and implementing many interconnected configurations.


  This solution implements Google Cloud''s enterprise foundation blueprint with security
  controls, networking, identity management, and governance policies. It creates organizational
  structure, sets up billing, configures logging and monitoring, and establishes policies
  that enforce security requirements. The landing zone provides teams with secure
  project environments while maintaining centralized oversight.
