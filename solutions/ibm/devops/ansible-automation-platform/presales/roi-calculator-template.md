## ROI Calculation Framework

### 1. Cost Avoidance Calculations

#### Deployment Time Savings
```python
# Current state deployment cost
manual_deployment_cost = (manual_deployment_time / 60) * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * deployments_per_month * 12

# Future state with automation (95% time reduction)
automated_deployment_time = manual_deployment_time * 0.05
automated_deployment_cost = (automated_deployment_time / 60) * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * deployments_per_month * 12

# Annual savings
deployment_savings = manual_deployment_cost - automated_deployment_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Manual deployment cost: 240 min × $40.87/hour × 200/month × 12 = **$392,000/year**
- Automated deployment cost: 12 min × $40.87/hour × 200/month × 12 = **$19,600/year**
- **Annual savings: $372,400**

#### Incident Response Savings
```python
# Current incident response cost
manual_incident_cost = (incident_resolution_time / 60) * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * incidents_per_month * 12

# Future state (80% time reduction)
automated_incident_time = incident_resolution_time * 0.20
automated_incident_cost = (automated_incident_time / 60) * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * incidents_per_month * 12

# Annual savings
incident_savings = manual_incident_cost - automated_incident_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Manual incident cost: 180 min × $40.87/hour × 150/month × 12 = **$221,000/year**
- Automated incident cost: 36 min × $40.87/hour × 150/month × 12 = **$44,200/year**
- **Annual savings: $176,800**

#### Configuration Management Savings
```python
# Current configuration management cost
manual_config_cost = config_management_hours * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * config_changes_per_month * 12

# Future state (90% time reduction)
automated_config_hours = config_management_hours * 0.10
automated_config_cost = automated_config_hours * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * config_changes_per_month * 12

# Annual savings
config_savings = manual_config_cost - automated_config_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Manual config cost: 20 hours × $40.87/hour × 300/month × 12 = **$2,940,000/year**
- Automated config cost: 2 hours × $40.87/hour × 300/month × 12 = **$294,000/year**
- **Annual savings: $2,646,000**

#### Compliance Audit Savings
```python
# Current compliance audit cost
manual_audit_cost = compliance_audit_hours * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * audits_per_year

# Future state (85% time reduction)
automated_audit_hours = compliance_audit_hours * 0.15
automated_audit_cost = automated_audit_hours * (avg_salary_ops / 2080) * audits_per_year

# Annual savings
audit_savings = manual_audit_cost - automated_audit_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Manual audit cost: 160 hours × $40.87/hour × 4/year = **$26,160/year**
- Automated audit cost: 24 hours × $40.87/hour × 4/year = **$3,920/year**
- **Annual savings: $22,240**

### 2. Business Value Calculations

#### Faster Time-to-Market Value
```python
# Revenue acceleration from faster deployments
revenue_per_deployment = annual_revenue / (deployments_per_month * 12)
time_to_market_improvement = 0.60  # 60% faster
ttm_value = revenue_per_deployment * deployments_per_month * 12 * time_to_market_improvement * 0.05  # 5% revenue impact
```

#### Improved System Reliability
```python
# Cost of downtime avoidance
downtime_cost_per_hour = annual_revenue / (24 * 365)
downtime_reduction_hours = 50  # Estimated annual hours prevented
reliability_value = downtime_cost_per_hour * downtime_reduction_hours
```

#### Developer Productivity Gains
```python
# Developer time freed up from infrastructure tasks
dev_time_freed = ops_team_size * 0.25 * 2080  # 25% of ops team time
dev_productivity_value = (dev_time_freed / 2080) * avg_salary_dev
```

### 3. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

#### Year 1 Costs
```python
year_1_costs = aap_license_cost + professional_services + infrastructure_cost + training_cost
```

#### Annual Recurring Costs (Year 2+)
```python
annual_recurring_costs = aap_license_cost + ongoing_support + (infrastructure_cost * 0.20) + (training_cost * 0.33)
```

### 4. Financial Metrics

#### Return on Investment (ROI)
```python
# Total annual benefits
total_annual_benefits = deployment_savings + incident_savings + config_savings + audit_savings + ttm_value + reliability_value + dev_productivity_value

# 3-year analysis
year_1_roi = (total_annual_benefits - year_1_costs) / year_1_costs * 100
three_year_total_benefits = total_annual_benefits * 3
three_year_total_costs = year_1_costs + (annual_recurring_costs * 2)
three_year_roi = (three_year_total_benefits - three_year_total_costs) / three_year_total_costs * 100

# Payback period (months)
payback_months = year_1_costs / (total_annual_benefits / 12)
```
