description: IT automation platform for operational efficiency
long_description: 'IT operations teams manage thousands of servers, network devices,
  and cloud resources using manual procedures or custom scripts. This approach is
  error-prone, time-consuming, and doesn''t scale. Changes made manually are difficult
  to track, audit, and reverse when problems occur. Knowledge about how systems are
  configured exists in people''s heads rather than in documented, testable code.


  This solution implements Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to automate IT operations
  across infrastructure. It provides automation playbooks for common tasks, centralized
  execution and scheduling, and role-based access control. Teams can automate server
  configuration, application deployment, and routine maintenance tasks with auditable,
  version-controlled automation code. The solution reduces manual errors and frees
  IT staff for higher-value work.
