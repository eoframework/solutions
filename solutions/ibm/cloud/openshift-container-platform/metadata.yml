description: Enterprise container platform for modern applications
long_description: "Organizations adopting containers need a platform that runs applications\
  \ consistently across different environments\u2014data center, cloud, and edge.\
  \ Kubernetes alone requires significant expertise and additional tools for logging,\
  \ monitoring, networking, and security. Development teams need self-service capabilities\
  \ while operations teams need control and visibility.\n\nThis solution deploys Red\
  \ Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud as an enterprise Kubernetes platform. It adds developer\
  \ tools, integrated CI/CD, security policies, and operational capabilities on top\
  \ of Kubernetes. The platform provides a consistent runtime environment across locations,\
  \ includes built-in monitoring and logging, and gives developers self-service application\
  \ deployment with guardrails.\n"
