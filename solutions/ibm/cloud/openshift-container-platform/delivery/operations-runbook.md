# IBM OpenShift Operations Runbook

## Operations Overview
Comprehensive operational procedures for managing IBM OpenShift Container Platform environments.

## Daily Operations

### Cluster Health Monitoring
- Node status verification
- Pod health checks
- Resource utilization review
- Storage capacity monitoring

### Application Monitoring
- Service availability checks
- Performance metric analysis
- Log aggregation review
- Alert response procedures

## Incident Response

### Common Issues

#### Node Problems
- Node not ready status
- Resource exhaustion
- Network connectivity issues
- Storage mount failures

#### Application Issues
- Pod crash loops
- Service discovery failures
- Ingress routing problems
- Database connectivity issues

#### Cluster-wide Issues
- API server unavailability

- Certificate expiration

## Maintenance Procedures

### Routine Maintenance
- Cluster updates and patches
- Certificate renewal
- Log rotation and cleanup
- Backup verification

### Capacity Management
- Resource quota monitoring
- Scaling recommendations
- Performance optimization
- Cost analysis

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Cluster Diagnostics
```bash
# Check cluster status
oc get nodes
oc get pods --all-namespaces
oc get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

# Resource utilization
oc adm top nodes
oc adm top pods

# Cluster health
oc get clusteroperators
oc get clusterversion
```

### Log Collection
```bash
# Pod logs
oc logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Node logs
oc debug node/<node-name>

# Cluster logs
oc adm must-gather
```
