# IBM Openshift Container Platform - Deployment Scripts

## Overview

This directory contains deployment automation scripts for IBM Openshift Container Platform solution using IBM OpenShift, AWS Infrastructure. The scripts work together in a specific sequence to create a complete cloud solution.

## Script Architecture

### Script Types & Dependencies

**üìã EXECUTION ORDER: Sequential (terraform ‚Üí python ‚Üí bash)**

The scripts are **NOT standalone** - they must be executed in the correct order as they have dependencies on each other.

1. **Terraform Scripts** - Infrastructure provisioning
2. **Python Scripts** - Application deployment
3. **Bash Scripts** - System configuration and validation

## Deployment Instructions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Scripts Must Run in Sequence

### Step 1: Infrastructure Provisioning (REQUIRED FIRST)

```bash
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ Provisions cloud infrastructure resources
- ‚úÖ Sets up networking and security configurations
- ‚úÖ Creates resource dependencies and relationships
- ‚úÖ Outputs resource identifiers for next steps

**Duration:** ~35-50 minutes
### Step 2: Application Deployment (REQUIRED NEXT)

```bash
cd python/
python3 deploy.py
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ Deploys application components
- ‚úÖ Configures API integrations
- ‚úÖ Sets up monitoring and alerting
- ‚úÖ Performs end-to-end validation

**Duration:** ~35-50 minutes  
**Dependencies:** Requires resources created by terraform scripts
### Step 3: System Configuration And Validation (REQUIRED NEXT)

```bash
cd bash/
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ Performs system-level configuration
- ‚úÖ Installs required packages and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Configures services and applications
- ‚úÖ Runs validation and health checks

**Duration:** ~35-50 minutes  
**Dependencies:** Requires resources created by python scripts

## Usage After Deployment

### Accessing the Solution

The deployed Openshift Container Platform solution provides the following capabilities:

#### Service Endpoints
- Primary interface: Available via cloud provider console
- API endpoints: Configured during deployment
- Monitoring dashboards: Integrated with cloud monitoring

#### Management Commands
```bash
# Check deployment status

# Monitor solution health
# (Provider-specific commands available in script output)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication/Credentials
```bash
Error: Authentication failed or credentials not found
Solution: Ensure cloud provider CLI is configured with appropriate credentials
```

#### 2. Insufficient Permissions  
```bash
Error: Access denied or permission errors
Solution: Verify account has required permissions listed in Prerequisites
```

#### 3. Resource Conflicts
```bash
Error: Resource already exists or naming conflicts
Solution: Choose unique PROJECT_NAME or clean up existing resources
```

#### 4. Deployment Timeout
```bash
Error: Deployment exceeded timeout limits
Solution: Check network connectivity and resource availability in target region
```

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify all components are deployed
cd bash/
# Run validation commands specific to solution type
# (Detailed commands available in individual scripts)
```

### Cleanup

#### Remove All Resources
```bash
# WARNING: This will delete all created resources
cd terraform/
terraform destroy
```
