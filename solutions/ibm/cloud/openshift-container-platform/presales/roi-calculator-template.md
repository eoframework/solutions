## ROI Calculation Framework

### 1. Developer Productivity Benefits

#### Accelerated Development Cycles
```python
# Current state development cost
current_dev_cycle_cost = (
    (average_development_cycle / 365) * 
    (development_team_size * average_developer_salary) * 
    (new_applications_per_year + application_updates_per_year)
)

# Future state with OpenShift (70% reduction in cycle time)
future_dev_cycle_days = average_development_cycle * 0.30
future_dev_cycle_cost = (
    (future_dev_cycle_days / 365) * 
    (development_team_size * average_developer_salary) * 
    (new_applications_per_year + application_updates_per_year)
)

# Annual savings
development_cycle_savings = current_dev_cycle_cost - future_dev_cycle_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Current development cost: 180 days × 400 developers × $125K × (120+2,400)/365 = **$15.07M/year**
- Future development cost: 54 days × 400 developers × $125K × (120+2,400)/365 = **$4.52M/year**
- **Annual savings: $10.55M**

#### Environment Provisioning Savings
```python
# Current provisioning cost
environments_per_year = (new_applications_per_year * 4) + (application_updates_per_year * 2)
current_provisioning_cost = (
    (environment_provisioning_time / 60 / 8) * 
    (average_ops_salary / 250) * 
    environments_per_year
)

# Future state (95% reduction in provisioning time)
future_provisioning_time = environment_provisioning_time * 0.05
future_provisioning_cost = (
    (future_provisioning_time / 60 / 8) * 
    (average_ops_salary / 250) * 
    environments_per_year
)

# Annual savings
provisioning_savings = current_provisioning_cost - future_provisioning_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Environments needed: (120 × 4) + (2,400 × 2) = 5,280/year
- Current provisioning cost: 48 hours × $52.50/hour × 5,280 = **$1.33M/year**
- Future provisioning cost: 2.4 hours × $52.50/hour × 5,280 = **$0.067M/year**
- **Annual savings: $1.26M**

#### Deployment Efficiency Gains
```python
# Deployment frequency improvement benefit
current_deployments_per_year = applications_in_portfolio * 12  # Monthly
future_deployments_per_year = applications_in_portfolio * 52   # Weekly

# Value from faster feature delivery (revenue acceleration)
feature_velocity_value = (
    (future_deployments_per_year - current_deployments_per_year) * 
    0.001 * annual_revenue  # 0.1% revenue per additional deployment
)

# Deployment failure cost reduction
current_failure_cost = (
    current_deployments_per_year * deployment_failure_rate * 
    (mean_time_to_recovery / 60) * (average_ops_salary / 2080) * 5  # 5 people involved
)
future_failure_cost = current_failure_cost * 0.10  # 90% reduction in failures

deployment_failure_savings = current_failure_cost - future_failure_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Feature velocity value: (23,400 - 5,400) × 0.001 × $10B = **$18M/year**
- Current failure cost: 5,400 × 0.25 × 8 hours × $50.48 × 5 = **$272K/year**
- Future failure cost: $272K × 0.10 = **$27K/year**
- **Deployment failure savings: $245K/year**

### 2. Infrastructure Cost Optimization

#### Compute Resource Efficiency
```python
# Current infrastructure cost
current_compute_cost = current_cloud_spend * 0.60  # 60% is compute

# Improved utilization with containers (from 35% to 75%)
utilization_improvement = 0.75 / 0.35
compute_savings = current_compute_cost * (1 - (1 / utilization_improvement))

# Additional savings from rightsizing
rightsizing_savings = current_compute_cost * 0.25  # 25% rightsizing opportunity
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Current compute cost: $12M × 0.60 = **$7.2M/year**
- Utilization savings: $7.2M × (1 - 0.467) = **$3.84M/year**
- Rightsizing savings: $7.2M × 0.25 = **$1.8M/year**
- **Total compute savings: $5.64M/year**

#### Storage Optimization
```python
# Storage cost optimization
current_storage_cost = current_cloud_spend * 0.25  # 25% is storage
storage_efficiency_gain = 0.40  # 40% storage optimization
storage_savings = current_storage_cost * storage_efficiency_gain

# Dynamic provisioning benefits
over_provisioning_reduction = current_storage_cost * 0.30
dynamic_provisioning_savings = over_provisioning_reduction
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Current storage cost: $12M × 0.25 = **$3M/year**
- Storage efficiency savings: $3M × 0.40 = **$1.2M/year**
- Dynamic provisioning savings: $3M × 0.30 = **$900K/year**
- **Total storage savings: $2.1M/year**

### 3. Operational Efficiency Benefits

#### Automation Benefits
```python
# Manual operations cost
manual_ops_hours_annual = operations_team_size * 2080 * manual_operations_percentage
current_manual_ops_cost = manual_ops_hours_annual * (average_ops_salary / 2080)

# Automation reduces manual work by 80%
future_manual_ops_cost = current_manual_ops_cost * 0.20
automation_savings = current_manual_ops_cost - future_manual_ops_cost
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Manual operations cost: 150 × 2080 × 0.80 × ($105K/2080) = **$12.6M/year**
- Future manual operations cost: $12.6M × 0.20 = **$2.52M/year**
- **Automation savings: $10.08M/year**

#### Security and Compliance Benefits
```python
# Security incident cost reduction
current_security_cost = security_incidents_per_year * 50000  # $50K per incident
future_security_cost = current_security_cost * 0.25  # 75% reduction
security_savings = current_security_cost - future_security_cost

# Compliance automation savings
compliance_hours_cost = compliance_audit_hours * (average_ops_salary / 2080)
compliance_automation_savings = compliance_hours_cost * 0.85  # 85% automation
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Security incident savings: (24 × $50K) - (24 × 0.25 × $50K) = **$900K/year**
- Compliance savings: 2,000 hours × $50.48 × 0.85 = **$85.8K/year**
- **Total security/compliance savings: $986K/year**

### 4. Business Value Creation

#### Faster Time-to-Market Value
```python
# Revenue acceleration from faster delivery
market_responsiveness_value = annual_revenue * 0.02  # 2% revenue increase
innovation_velocity_value = annual_revenue * 0.015   # 1.5% from innovation

time_to_market_value = market_responsiveness_value + innovation_velocity_value
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Market responsiveness: $10B × 0.02 = **$200M/year**
- Innovation velocity: $10B × 0.015 = **$150M/year**
- **Total time-to-market value: $350M/year**

#### Customer Experience Improvement
```python
# Improved application performance and reliability
customer_satisfaction_value = annual_revenue * 0.005  # 0.5% from better CX
reduced_churn_value = annual_revenue * 0.003         # 0.3% from reduced churn

customer_value = customer_satisfaction_value + reduced_churn_value
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Customer satisfaction value: $10B × 0.005 = **$50M/year**
- Reduced churn value: $10B × 0.003 = **$30M/year**
- **Total customer value: $80M/year**
