### Solution Overview
**Comprehensive Migration Journey to AWS**

![Architecture Diagram](assets/diagrams/architecture-diagram.png)

- **Migration Approach**
  - Discovery with Application Discovery Service maps dependencies and complexity
  - Migration tools: DMS for databases, SMS for servers, DataSync for data transfer
  - Migration Hub provides centralized tracking across all migration waves
- **AWS Landing Zone**
  - Multi-account structure with Control Tower and Organizations for governance
  - Production infrastructure: Auto Scaling EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, VPC networking
  - Site-to-Site VPN enables secure hybrid connectivity during phased migration

---

### Implementation Approach
**Proven AWS Migration Methodology**

- **Phase 1: Discovery & Assessment (Months 1-2)**
  - Application discovery and dependency mapping with AWS tools
  - Migration readiness assessment and wave planning (lift-shift vs replatform)
  - AWS landing zone design and account structure setup
- **Phase 2: Migration Execution (Months 3-6)**
  - Wave 1: Non-critical applications for validation and learning
  - Wave 2: Business-critical applications with tested migration patterns
  - Wave 3: Complex/legacy applications requiring refactoring
- **Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7-9)**
  - Right-sizing based on CloudWatch metrics and usage patterns
  - Cost optimization through Reserved Instances and Savings Plans
  - Security hardening and compliance validation

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

*Risk Mitigation:*
- Discovery phase identifies dependencies before migration starts
- Wave approach allows validation and learning with lower-risk apps first
- Hybrid connectivity maintains business continuity during migration

*Success Factors:*
- Application owners engaged for validation and cutover approval
- Maintenance windows available for migration activities
- Executive sponsorship for organizational change management

*Talking Points:*
- Start with discovery - you can't migrate what you don't understand
- Wave approach de-risks migration with incremental validation
- Optimization in Phase 3 delivers cost savings post-migration

### Investment Summary
**Total Investment & Value**

<!-- BEGIN COST_SUMMARY_TABLE -->
| Cost Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year Total |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Professional Services | $514,000 | $0 | $0 | $514,000 |
| Cloud Infrastructure | $200,532 | $25,282 | $25,282 | $251,096 |
| Software Licenses & Subscriptions | $25,000 | $0 | $0 | $25,000 |
| **TOTAL SOLUTION INVESTMENT** | **$739,532** | **$25,282** | **$25,282** | **$790,096** |
<!-- END COST_SUMMARY_TABLE -->

**Annual Operating Costs (Years 2-3):** $25,282/year
- Cloud Infrastructure (right-sized workloads): $25,282/year
- No data center costs (facilities, power, cooling eliminated)

**Total 3-Year TCO:** $790,096

**Cost Comparison:**
- On-Premises 3-Year Cost: $2.1M (hardware refresh, data center, staffing)
- AWS 3-Year TCO: $790K
- **Net Savings: $1.31M over 3 years**

Detailed cost breakdown including migration services, AWS consumption, and cost comparison is provided in cost-breakdown.xlsx.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

*Value Positioning:*
- Frame as transformation investment with immediate cost savings
- Highlight Year 1 includes full migration (one-time)
- Ongoing costs (Years 2-3) significantly lower than data center operations
- Net savings of $1.31M over 3 years demonstrates clear ROI

*Cost Breakdown Strategy:*
- Professional services cover discovery, migration, and optimization
- Cloud costs include one-time data transfer and ongoing infrastructure
- AWS Migration credits (10-25%) reduce actual Year 1 costs
- No hidden costs - transparent pricing model

*Handling Objections:*
- "Can we migrate ourselves?" - Highlight risk and time-to-value tradeoffs
- "Why professional services?" - Show proven methodology reduces failures
- "What if migration fails?" - Point to wave approach and contingency planning
- "How do we control cloud costs?" - Explain optimization in Phase 3 and FinOps

*Talking Points:*
- Compare $740K to $3M data center upgrade avoided
- Migration pays for itself through hardware/facility cost elimination
