# AWS On-Premise to Cloud Migration - Prerequisites

This document outlines the requirements and preparations needed for a successful AWS cloud migration.

## Assessment Phase Requirements

### Infrastructure Assessment
- **Asset Inventory**: Complete inventory of servers, applications, and databases
- **Dependency Mapping**: Application interdependencies and data flows
- **Performance Baselines**: Current CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization
- **Security Assessment**: Current security posture and compliance requirements

### Tools and Access
- **AWS Application Discovery Service**: For automated infrastructure discovery
- **AWS Migration Evaluator**: For cost and performance analysis
- **Network Access**: Connectivity for agent deployment and data collection

## Technical Prerequisites

### AWS Account Setup
- **AWS Organizations**: Multi-account strategy for migration isolation
- **Service Control Policies**: Governance and security policies
- **AWS Config**: Configuration compliance monitoring
- **CloudTrail**: API activity logging and auditing

### Network Requirements
- **Bandwidth**: Minimum 100 Mbps dedicated bandwidth for data transfer
- **Latency**: <50ms latency to target AWS region
- **Connectivity Options**:
  - AWS Direct Connect (recommended for large migrations)
  - Site-to-Site VPN (backup or small migrations)
  - Internet connectivity (for tools and management)

### Security Prerequisites
- **IAM Roles**: Migration-specific service roles
- **KMS Keys**: Customer-managed encryption keys
- **Certificate Management**: SSL/TLS certificates for applications
- **Security Groups**: Network access control definitions

## Application Assessment

### Application Readiness
- **Cloud Readiness Assessment**: Application compatibility with AWS
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data identification and handling
- **Licensing**: Software license compatibility with cloud deployment
- **Integration Points**: External system dependencies

### Database Assessment  
- **Database Inventory**: All database instances and versions
- **Schema Analysis**: Database schema complexity assessment
- **Data Volume**: Storage requirements and transfer estimates
- **Replication Requirements**: RTO/RPO objectives

## Organizational Prerequisites

### Team Preparation
- **Migration Team**: Dedicated resources for migration execution
- **Training**: AWS skills development for operations team
- **Change Management**: Process for handling migration changes
- **Communication Plan**: Stakeholder communication strategy

### Compliance and Governance
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Industry-specific compliance needs
- **Data Governance**: Data handling and residency requirements
- **Audit Requirements**: Documentation and audit trail needs
- **Risk Assessment**: Migration risk identification and mitigation

## Migration Planning

### Timeline and Phases
- **Migration Waves**: Application grouping and sequencing
- **Testing Strategy**: Pre-production testing approach
- **Rollback Plans**: Fallback procedures for each migration wave
- **Go-Live Procedures**: Cutover and validation processes

### Capacity Planning
- **Compute Resources**: Right-sizing for AWS instance types
- **Storage Requirements**: Data volume and performance needs
- **Network Bandwidth**: Data transfer capacity planning
- **Backup and Recovery**: Backup strategy and retention policies
