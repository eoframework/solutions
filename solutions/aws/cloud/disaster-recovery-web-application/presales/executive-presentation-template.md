## Presentation Notes

### Speaking Points for Each Slide

**Slide 4 - Current Risk:**
- Emphasize the financial impact of downtime using client-specific data
- Reference recent industry outages and their business impact
- Create urgency around unprotected risk exposure

**Slide 8 - Risk Mitigation ROI:**
- Explain how risk-adjusted ROI accounts for probability of disasters
- Walk through the risk mitigation value calculation
- Emphasize that ROI improves if disasters are more frequent/costly

**Slide 12 - Investment:**
- Compare DR investment to potential cost of a single major outage
- Explain that AWS DR costs scale with usage
- Highlight cost savings vs traditional DR approaches

### Q&A Preparation

**Common Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "How do we know the automated failover will work when needed?"**
A: "We implement comprehensive testing procedures including quarterly DR drills and chaos engineering practices to validate failover reliability."

**Q: "What if AWS itself has an outage affecting multiple regions?"**
A: "AWS has never had a simultaneous multi-region outage. We design across availability zones and regions with independent infrastructure and power."

**Q: "How does this compare to our current backup strategy?"**
A: "Traditional backups provide data recovery but not business continuity. Our DR solution maintains running applications with minimal downtime."
