## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```python

from document_processor import DocumentProcessor

def test_document_classification():
    processor = DocumentProcessor()
    result = processor.classify_document('sample_invoice.pdf')
    assert result['document_type'] == 'INVOICE'
    assert result['confidence'] > 0.95

def test_data_extraction():
    processor = DocumentProcessor()
    result = processor.extract_data('sample_invoice.pdf')
    assert 'invoice_number' in result
    assert 'vendor_name' in result
    assert 'total_amount' in result
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# integration_test.sh

echo "Running integration tests..."

# Test document upload
aws s3 cp test_documents/ s3://document-bucket/test/ --recursive

# Test processing pipeline
python test_pipeline.py

# Validate results
python validate_extraction.py
```

### Performance Testing
```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def load_test_document_processing():
    def process_document(doc_path):
        # Simulate document processing
        start_time = time.time()
        result = process_single_document(doc_path)
        end_time = time.time()
        return end_time - start_time
    
    documents = ['doc1.pdf', 'doc2.pdf'] * 50  # 100 documents
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(process_document, documents))
    
    avg_time = sum(results) / len(results)
    print(f"Average processing time: {avg_time:.2f} seconds")

**Quick Resolution:**
- Verify SageMaker endpoint status and auto-scaling configuration
- Check Textract and Comprehend service limits and quotas
- Validate document formats and size limits
- Review model training data quality and coverage

#### Network and Connectivity Issues
**Symptoms:** API timeouts, SSL certificate errors, DNS resolution failures
**Quick Resolution:**

- Implement CloudFront caching for static resources

### Escalation Procedures
- **Level 1 Issues** (< 2 hours): Configuration, permission, basic connectivity
- **Level 2 Issues** (2-4 hours): Performance optimization, complex integrations
- **Level 3 Issues** (> 4 hours): Architecture changes, security incidents

**Required Information for Escalation:**
- Detailed error messages and symptoms
- Environment details and recent changes
- Relevant log excerpts from CloudWatch
- Current system metrics and performance data
