# AWS Intelligent Document Processing - Prerequisites

This document outlines the system requirements, dependencies, and prerequisites needed to deploy and operate the AWS intelligent document processing solution.

## AWS Account Requirements

### Service Access
- **AWS Account**: Active AWS account with sufficient permissions
- **Service Limits**: Verify service limits for:
  - Lambda concurrent executions (minimum 100)
  - S3 storage capacity (as needed for document volume)
  - Textract API rate limits (as per workload requirements)
  - Comprehend API rate limits

### IAM Permissions
The deployment requires the following AWS service permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*",
        "lambda:*",
        "sqs:*",
        "iam:*",
        "textract:*",
        "comprehend:*",
        "logs:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Requirements

### AWS Services
- **Amazon S3**: Document storage and processing results
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless processing functions
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for processing workflow
- **Amazon Textract**: OCR and document analysis
- **Amazon Comprehend**: Natural language processing and entity extraction
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring

### Optional Services
- **Amazon Kendra**: For advanced document search capabilities
- **AWS Step Functions**: For complex workflow orchestration
- **Amazon SNS**: For notification and alerting

## Network and Security

### Network Configuration
- **VPC**: Default VPC is sufficient, or existing VPC with internet access
- **Subnets**: Public or private subnets with NAT gateway for private
- **Security Groups**: Lambda functions need outbound internet access

### Security Requirements
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for IAM roles
- **Compliance**: Ensure document types meet regulatory requirements

## Document Format Support

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, TIFF
- **Documents**: PDF (text and image-based)
- **Maximum File Size**: 10 MB per document (Textract limit)
- **Maximum Pages**: 500 pages per PDF document

### Document Quality Requirements
- **Resolution**: Minimum 150 DPI for optimal OCR results
- **Image Quality**: Clear, well-lit documents with minimal skew
- **Language Support**: English (primary), with support for 100+ languages

## Deployment Tools

### Required Software
- **Terraform**: Version 1.0 or higher for infrastructure deployment
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher for deployment scripts
- **AWS CLI**: Version 2.x configured with appropriate credentials
- **Git**: For source code management

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install boto3>=1.26.0
pip install requests>=2.28.0
pip install python-json-logger>=2.0.0
```

## Capacity Planning

### Processing Volume
- **Documents per hour**: Up to 1,000 documents (with default Lambda concurrency)
- **Storage**: Plan for 3x original document size for processed results
- **Lambda memory**: 512 MB minimum, adjust based on document size

### Cost Considerations
- **Pay-per-use**: All services scale based on actual usage
- **Textract**: $1.50 per 1,000 pages processed
- **Lambda**: $0.20 per 1M requests + compute time
- **S3**: Standard storage pricing applies

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] AWS account with required service access
- [ ] IAM user/role with deployment permissions
- [ ] AWS CLI configured and tested
- [ ] Terraform installed and configured
- [ ] Python environment with required dependencies
- [ ] S3 bucket naming convention decided (must be globally unique)
- [ ] Document volume and processing requirements estimated
- [ ] Security and compliance requirements reviewed
- [ ] Network architecture planned (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting strategy defined

## Support and Documentation
