**SPEAKER NOTES:**

*Value Positioning with Credits (Small Scope):*
- **Lead with credits:** "You qualify for $15K in AWS partner credits"
- This is a **department-level pilot** with immediate cost reduction through partnerships
- Net Year 1 investment of **$101K** (not $116K) after partner credits
- Small scope = lower risk, faster ROI validation, PLUS partner funding

*Credit Program Talking Points:*
- **AWS Partner Services Credit ($10K):** Applied to architecture design and AI/ML integration
- **AWS AI Services Credit ($5K):** First-year consumption credit for Textract/Comprehend usage
- Emphasize: **Real credits**, not marketing—applied to actual AWS bills
- We handle all paperwork and credit application—no burden on client

*Cost Breakdown Strategy:*
- Frame as **"$101K net investment"** not "$116K project"
- Professional services (310 hours) focused on core AI/ML setup, partner credits reduce by $10K
- Cloud costs sized for 50K pages/month with $5K Year 1 credit
- No hardware or infrastructure CapEx required - 100% OpEx model

*Handling Objections:*
- "Can we do this ourselves?" - Partner credits only available through certified AWS partners
- "Are credits guaranteed?" - Yes, subject to standard AWS partner program approval (we have 95% approval rate)
- "What if we need more capacity?" - AWS serverless auto-scales; additional volume may qualify for more credits
- "When do we get credits?" - Applied throughout Year 1 as services are consumed

*Small Scope Talking Points with Credits:*
- Compare $101K net Year 1 to cost of 1-2 FTEs doing manual data entry ($80K-$160K/year)
- Processing 50K pages/month = ~600K pages/year automated
- If current manual cost is $2-5 per page, ROI is 10-25x in year one
- **Partner credits make this a no-brainer financially**
- Pilot proves accuracy with your documents before scaling to enterprise volumes
