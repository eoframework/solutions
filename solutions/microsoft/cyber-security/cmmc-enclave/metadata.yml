description: CMMC-compliant secure enclave for defense contractors
long_description: 'Defense contractors must comply with CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity
  Model Certification) requirements to protect Controlled Unclassified Information
  (CUI). Meeting these requirements means implementing specific security controls,
  maintaining audit trails, and proving compliance. Building a compliant environment
  from scratch is complex and time-consuming without clear guidance on required configurations.


  This solution creates a secure enclave within Microsoft 365 and Azure that meets
  CMMC Level 2 requirements. It implements required security controls, configures
  audit logging, restricts data access, and provides compliance reporting. The enclave
  isolates CUI data and ensures only authorized users can access it through compliant
  methods.
