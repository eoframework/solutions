long_description: 'Organizations moving to Microsoft 365 face complexity in migrating
  email, enabling collaboration tools, and training users on new applications. Deployments
  often miss important configurations for security, compliance, and backup. Without
  proper planning, migrations disrupt users and businesses don''t realize the full
  value of Microsoft 365 capabilities.


  This solution provides a structured approach to deploy Microsoft 365 across the
  organization. It includes migration planning, email and data migration procedures,
  security baseline configurations, and user adoption materials. The solution covers
  Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and security features with templates
  and automation to accelerate deployment while maintaining security standards.
