# MICROSOFT M365 Deployment - Deployment Scripts

## Overview

This directory contains deployment automation scripts for MICROSOFT M365 Deployment solution using Cloud services. The scripts work together in a specific sequence to create a complete modern-workspace solution.

## Script Architecture

### Script Types & Dependencies

**📋 EXECUTION ORDER: Sequential (powershell → python)**

The scripts are **NOT standalone** - they must be executed in the correct order as they have dependencies on each other.

1. **Powershell Scripts** - Windows service deployment and configuration
2. **Python Scripts** - Cross-platform automation and integration

## Deployment Instructions

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Scripts Must Run in Sequence

### Step 1: Windows Service Deployment And Configuration (REQUIRED FIRST)

```bash
cd powershell/
./Deploy-Solution.ps1
```

**What this does:**

- ✅ Manages Active Directory integration
- ✅ Installs and configures applications
- ✅ Sets up monitoring and logging

**Duration:** ~10-15 minutes
### Step 2: Cross-Platform Automation And Integration (REQUIRED NEXT)

```bash
cd python/
python3 deploy.py
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Deploys application components
- ✅ Configures API integrations
- ✅ Sets up monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Performs end-to-end validation

**Duration:** ~10-15 minutes  
**Dependencies:** Requires resources created by powershell scripts

## Usage After Deployment

### Accessing the Solution

The deployed M365 Deployment solution provides the following capabilities:

#### Service Endpoints
- Primary interface: Available via cloud provider console
- API endpoints: Configured during deployment
- Monitoring dashboards: Integrated with cloud monitoring

#### Management Commands

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication/Credentials
```bash
Error: Authentication failed or credentials not found
Solution: Ensure cloud provider CLI is configured with appropriate credentials
```

#### 2. Insufficient Permissions  
```bash
Error: Access denied or permission errors
Solution: Verify account has required permissions listed in Prerequisites
```

#### 3. Resource Conflicts
```bash
Error: Resource already exists or naming conflicts
Solution: Choose unique PROJECT_NAME or clean up existing resources
```

#### 4. Deployment Timeout
```bash
Error: Deployment exceeded timeout limits
Solution: Check network connectivity and resource availability in target region
```

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify all components are deployed
cd powershell/
# Run validation commands specific to solution type
# (Detailed commands available in individual scripts)
```

### Cleanup

#### Remove All Resources
```bash
# WARNING: This will delete all created resources
```
