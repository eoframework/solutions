**SPEAKER NOTES:**

*Closing and Q&A Preparation:*

**Closing Statement:**
"Thank you for your partnership throughout this digital workplace transformation. We've successfully deployed Microsoft 365 E5 for 500 users, enabling modern collaboration with Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive while implementing enterprise-grade security with Defender and Purview.

I want to open the floor for questions. We have [time] remaining."

**Anticipated Questions and Prepared Answers:**

*Q: What if we need to add more users?*
A: M365 E5 licensing is per-user at $66.50/month. Simply add licenses and provision users. No infrastructure changes required. We can support thousands of additional users.

*Q: How do we maintain security compliance?*
A: Defender for Office 365 and Purview are continuously monitoring. Monthly security posture reviews are included in managed services. Quarterly compliance audits recommended.

*Q: What about training for new employees?*
A: Training materials are in SharePoint. Champions program provides peer support. Consider Microsoft Learning Pathways for self-service training.

*Q: When can we use Copilot?*
A: Microsoft Copilot for M365 is now available. E5 license is a prerequisite (which you have). Additional Copilot license is $30/user/month. We recommend a pilot with 50 users.

*Q: What if Teams call quality degrades?*
A: Teams admin center provides call quality analytics. ExpressRoute provides dedicated connectivity. QoS policies are configured on your network. Escalate to L3 if persistent issues.

**Demo Offer:**
"Would anyone like to see the M365 admin center, Teams analytics, or Defender security dashboard? I can show you real-time monitoring in action."

**Final Closing:**
"Thank you again for trusting our team with your workplace transformation. This M365 deployment positions [Client Name] for modern collaboration and continued innovation.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me or [Account Manager] if any questions arise. Have a great [rest of your day/afternoon]."
