### Implementation Approach
**layout:** eo_single_column

**Proven Methodology for Seamless Migration**

- **Phase 1: Foundation & Pilot (Months 1-2)**
  - Deploy Azure AD Connect for identity synchronization and configure SSO with MFA policies
  - Establish hybrid Exchange configuration enabling coexistence during migration period
  - Execute pilot migration with 50 users validating email SharePoint and Teams functionality
- **Phase 2: Production Migration (Months 2-3)**
  - Migrate remaining 450 users in departmental waves minimizing business disruption
  - Deploy Teams Phone System for 150 users with PSTN calling and audio conferencing
  - Configure SharePoint Online sites and migrate 5TB file data from on-premises file servers
- **Phase 3: Security & Optimization (Month 4)**
