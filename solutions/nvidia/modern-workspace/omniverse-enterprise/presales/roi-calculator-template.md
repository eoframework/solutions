## Benefits Quantification

### Collaboration Efficiency Gains

**Review Cycle Time Reduction**
```python
def calculate_review_cycle_savings(team_size, avg_salary, current_cycle_days, improved_cycle_days, projects_per_year):
    time_saved_per_cycle = current_cycle_days - improved_cycle_days
    daily_rate = avg_salary / 250  # working days per year
    savings_per_project = time_saved_per_cycle * daily_rate * team_size * 0.8  # 80% team involvement
    annual_savings = savings_per_project * projects_per_year
    return annual_savings

# Example Calculations:
Small Team (25 users):
  Current Cycle: 6 days
  Improved Cycle: 2 days (67% reduction)
  Projects/Year: 24
  Annual Savings: $173,000

Medium Team (100 users):
  Current Cycle: 6 days
  Improved Cycle: 2 days (67% reduction)
  Projects/Year: 60
  Annual Savings: $432,000

Large Team (500 users):
  Current Cycle: 6 days
  Improved Cycle: 2 days (67% reduction)
  Projects/Year: 200
  Annual Savings: $1,440,000
```

**Version Conflict Resolution**
```python
def calculate_conflict_resolution_savings(team_size, avg_salary, current_hours_monthly, improved_hours_monthly):
    hourly_rate = avg_salary / 2000  # 2000 working hours per year
    hours_saved_monthly = current_hours_monthly - improved_hours_monthly
    monthly_savings = hours_saved_monthly * hourly_rate
    annual_savings = monthly_savings * 12
    return annual_savings * team_size * 0.3  # 30% of team affected

# Example Calculations:
Small Team: $27,000 annually
Medium Team: $108,000 annually
