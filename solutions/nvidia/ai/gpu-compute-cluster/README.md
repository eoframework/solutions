# GPU Compute Cluster

**Provider:** Nvidia
**Category:** AI
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Scientific computing, simulations, and data analytics workloads need parallel processing power that traditional CPU-based systems can't provide efficiently. Setting up GPU computing requires expertise in hardware selection, driver configuration, and optimizing workloads to use GPUs effectively. Sharing GPU resources fairly among multiple users and jobs requires specialized cluster management.

This solution creates an NVIDIA GPU compute cluster for parallel processing workloads. It includes GPU servers, job scheduling, resource management, and monitoring configured specifically for GPU computing. Users can submit jobs that automatically utilize available GPUs, and administrators can manage resources and track utilization across the cluster.
