description: GPU cluster for parallel computing & AI workloads
long_description: 'Scientific computing, simulations, and data analytics workloads
  need parallel processing power that traditional CPU-based systems can''t provide
  efficiently. Setting up GPU computing requires expertise in hardware selection,
  driver configuration, and optimizing workloads to use GPUs effectively. Sharing
  GPU resources fairly among multiple users and jobs requires specialized cluster
  management.


  This solution creates an NVIDIA GPU compute cluster for parallel processing workloads.
  It includes GPU servers, job scheduling, resource management, and monitoring configured
  specifically for GPU computing. Users can submit jobs that automatically utilize
  available GPUs, and administrators can manage resources and track utilization across
  the cluster.
