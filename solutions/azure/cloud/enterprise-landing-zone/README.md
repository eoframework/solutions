# Enterprise Landing Zone

**Provider:** Azure
**Category:** Cloud
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Organizations moving to Azure need a secure, well-organized cloud foundation that supports multiple teams and workloads. Without proper setup, environments become disorganized, security gaps emerge, and managing costs and compliance becomes difficult. Building this foundation from scratch requires deep Azure expertise and understanding of best practices.

This solution implements Azure's Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone architecture, providing a secure foundation for cloud operations. It sets up management groups, subscriptions, networking, identity, security controls, and governance policies. The landing zone gives teams self-service capabilities while maintaining centralized security and compliance controls.
