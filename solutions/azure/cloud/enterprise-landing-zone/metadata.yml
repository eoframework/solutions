description: Secure Azure foundation for enterprise workloads
long_description: 'Organizations moving to Azure need a secure, well-organized cloud
  foundation that supports multiple teams and workloads. Without proper setup, environments
  become disorganized, security gaps emerge, and managing costs and compliance becomes
  difficult. Building this foundation from scratch requires deep Azure expertise and
  understanding of best practices.


  This solution implements Azure''s Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone architecture, providing
  a secure foundation for cloud operations. It sets up management groups, subscriptions,
  networking, identity, security controls, and governance policies. The landing zone
  gives teams self-service capabilities while maintaining centralized security and
  compliance controls.
