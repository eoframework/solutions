#### Change Categories and Approval Requirements

```yaml
Standard Changes:
  Definition: Pre-approved, low-risk, routine changes
  Examples: VM patching, certificate renewal, routine configuration
  Approval: Automated approval with documentation
  Timeline: Immediate implementation during maintenance window
  
Normal Changes:
  Definition: Changes requiring assessment and approval
  Examples: Infrastructure deployment, application updates
  Approval: Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval required
  Timeline: 5-10 business days for assessment and approval
  
Emergency Changes:
  Definition: Urgent changes to restore service or security
  Examples: Security patches, service restoration, incident response
  Approval: Emergency Change Advisory Board (eCAB)
  Timeline: Immediate implementation with post-change review

High-Risk Changes:
  Definition: Changes with significant business or technical impact
  Examples: Network architecture changes, major application releases
  Approval: Executive approval and extended CAB review
  Timeline: 15-30 business days with extensive testing
```

### Incident Response Procedures

#### Incident Classification and Response

```yaml
Severity Levels:
  P1 - Critical:
    Definition: Complete service outage or security breach
    Response Time: 15 minutes
    Resolution Target: 4 hours
    Notification: Immediate to all stakeholders
    
  P2 - High:
    Definition: Significant service degradation affecting multiple users
    Response Time: 1 hour
    Resolution Target: 24 hours
    Notification: Operations team and business stakeholders
    
  P3 - Medium:
    Definition: Service issues affecting limited users or functionality
    Response Time: 4 hours
    Resolution Target: 72 hours
    Notification: Operations team
    
  P4 - Low:
    Definition: Minor issues or feature requests
    Response Time: Next business day
    Resolution Target: 2 weeks
    Notification: Assigned team member
```

#### Incident Response Team Structure

```yaml
Incident Commander:
  Role: Overall incident coordination and decision-making
  Responsibilities: Stakeholder communication, resource allocation
  Authority: Full authority to make decisions and allocate resources
  
Technical Lead:
  Role: Technical investigation and resolution coordination  
  Responsibilities: Root cause analysis, technical solution implementation
  Escalation: Subject matter experts and vendor support
  
Communications Lead:
  Role: Stakeholder communication and status updates
  Responsibilities: Status page updates, executive briefings
  Tools: Teams, email, status dashboard
  
Business Liaison:
  Role: Business impact assessment and priority setting
  Responsibilities: Business continuity planning, workaround identification
  Authority: Business priority and resource allocation decisions
```

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization

#### Performance Baseline and Targets

```yaml
Infrastructure Performance Targets:
  Network Latency:
    Hub to Spoke: <5ms average
    Spoke to Spoke: <10ms average  
    Internet egress: <50ms average
    
  Compute Performance:
    CPU Utilization: 60-80% average (healthy range)
    Memory Utilization: 70-85% average (healthy range)
    Disk IOPS: <80% of provisioned IOPS
    
  Application Performance:
    Response Time: <2 seconds for web applications
    Throughput: Handle 1000+ concurrent users
    Availability: 99.9% uptime target
    
Storage Performance:
  Latency: <10ms for premium storage
  Throughput: 80% of provisioned throughput
  IOPS: 80% of provisioned IOPS
```

#### Automated Optimization Procedures

```yaml
Auto-Scaling Configuration:
  Virtual Machine Scale Sets:
    Scale-out trigger: CPU > 75% for 5 minutes
    Scale-in trigger: CPU < 25% for 10 minutes
    Minimum instances: 2
    Maximum instances: 20
    
  Application Services:
    Scale-out trigger: Requests > 1000/minute
    Scale-in trigger: Requests < 200/minute  
    Scale-out cooldown: 10 minutes
    Scale-in cooldown: 20 minutes
    
Cost Optimization:
  Reserved Instances: Automatic recommendations
  VM Right-sizing: Monthly analysis and recommendations
  Storage Tiering: Automated lifecycle management
  Resource Cleanup: Automated deletion of unused resources
