## Financial Modeling

### ROI Calculation Framework

**Return on Investment (ROI)**
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100

5-Year ROI Example:
Benefits: $45M - Investment: $8M = $37M Net Benefit
ROI = ($37M / $8M) × 100 = 463%
```

**Net Present Value (NPV)**
```
NPV = Σ [Benefits_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Where:
- Benefits_t = Benefits in year t
- r = Discount rate (typically 8-12% for enterprise IT investments)
- t = Time period (years)

Example with 10% discount rate:
Year 0: -$2.5M (investment)
Year 1: $4.2M / 1.1 = $3.82M
Year 2: $6.8M / 1.1² = $5.62M
Year 3: $8.5M / 1.1³ = $6.38M
Year 4: $9.2M / 1.1⁴ = $6.29M
Year 5: $10.1M / 1.1⁵ = $6.27M

NPV = -$2.5M + $28.38M = $25.88M
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
```
IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0

Typical Enterprise Landing Zone IRR range: 125-200%
```

**Payback Period**
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Average Cash Flow

Example:
$2.5M investment / $7.8M annual average benefit = 3.8 months
```
