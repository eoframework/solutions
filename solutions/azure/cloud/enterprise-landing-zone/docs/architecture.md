## Data Flow

### Identity and Access Flow
1. Users authenticate through Azure AD with MFA and conditional access
2. PIM provides just-in-time access to privileged resources
3. RBAC policies enforce least-privilege access across all subscriptions
4. Identity events logged and monitored through Azure AD reporting

### Network Traffic Flow
1. External traffic enters through Azure Front Door or Application Gateway
2. Traffic flows through Azure Firewall for inspection and filtering
3. Internal traffic routed between spokes through hub network
4. On-premises connectivity via ExpressRoute or VPN connections
5. DNS resolution through private DNS zones and custom DNS servers

### Monitoring and Compliance Flow
1. All Azure resources send logs to centralized Log Analytics workspaces
2. Azure Policy evaluates compliance continuously across all subscriptions
3. Security Center provides threat detection and security recommendations
4. Cost Management tracks spending and provides optimization recommendations
5. Alerts and notifications sent to appropriate teams based on severity

## Security Considerations

### Defense in Depth Strategy
- **Network Security**: Network segmentation, micro-segmentation, and zero-trust principles
- **Identity Protection**: Multi-factor authentication, conditional access, and identity governance
- **Application Security**: Web application firewalls, API management, and secure development practices
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, data classification, and loss prevention
- **Infrastructure Security**: VM security baselines, patch management, and vulnerability scanning

### Zero Trust Architecture
- **Verify Explicitly**: Never trust, always verify identity and device compliance
- **Least Privilege Access**: Just-in-time and just-enough access principles
