# Troubleshooting Guide - Azure DevOps Enterprise Platform

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Pipeline Failures and Agent Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Build pipelines failing with agent connectivity issues
- Jobs queued indefinitely without being assigned to agents
- Self-hosted agents showing offline or disconnected status
- Inconsistent build results across different agents

**Causes:**
- Network connectivity issues between agents and Azure DevOps services
- Insufficient agent pool capacity for concurrent job execution
- Agent software version compatibility issues or outdated capabilities
- Firewall or proxy blocking required Azure DevOps service endpoints
- Agent authentication token expiration or permission issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify network connectivity and firewall rules for Azure DevOps service tags
2. Increase agent pool capacity or configure auto-scaling for demand
3. Update agent software to latest version and refresh capabilities
4. Regenerate agent authentication tokens and restart agent services
5. Check agent logs for specific error messages and resolution guidance

### Issue 2: Git Repository Access and Permission Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Unable to clone or push to repositories with authentication failures
- Access denied errors when accessing specific branches or files
- Pull request creation failures or merge conflicts
- Repository permissions not reflecting expected access levels

**Causes:**
- Incorrect Git credentials or expired personal access tokens
- Branch policies blocking required operations or user access
- Repository permissions not properly configured or inherited
- Azure AD group membership changes affecting repository access
- Git client configuration issues or credential caching problems

**Solutions:**
1. Regenerate personal access tokens with appropriate scopes and permissions
2. Review and adjust branch policies for required operations and user groups
3. Verify repository permissions and Azure AD group membership
4. Clear Git credential cache and reconfigure authentication
5. Test repository access using different Git clients and authentication methods

### Issue 3: Service Connection Authentication Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Deployment pipelines failing with authentication errors to Azure resources
- Cannot connect to external services during pipeline execution
- Service principal authentication timeouts or token failures
- Certificate-based authentication not working for service connections

**Causes:**
- Service principal credentials expired or permissions changed
- Azure resource access policies blocking service principal access
- Certificate expiration or incorrect certificate configuration
- Network connectivity issues to target services or resources
- Conditional access policies blocking automated service connections

**Solutions:**
1. Verify service principal credentials and renew if expired
2. Review Azure resource permissions and access policies for service principals
3. Update certificates and validate certificate-based authentication configuration
4. Test network connectivity to target services from pipeline agents
5. Configure conditional access policy exemptions for service automation

### Issue 4: Package Feed and Artifact Management Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Cannot publish packages to Azure Artifacts feeds
- Package restoration failures in build pipelines
- Slow package download speeds or timeout errors
- Package versioning conflicts or duplication issues

**Causes:**
- Insufficient permissions to publish or consume packages
- Network connectivity issues to Azure Artifacts service
- Package size exceeding feed limits or organization quotas
- Feed indexing delays or service performance issues
- Incorrect feed configuration or authentication settings

**Solutions:**
1. Verify user permissions for package feed operations and scope access
2. Check network connectivity and configure package source priorities
3. Review package sizes and organization quota limits
4. Monitor Azure Artifacts service health and performance status
5. Reconfigure package feed authentication and upstream sources

### Issue 5: Work Item Tracking and Process Template Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Work items not syncing between projects or external systems
- Custom fields or work item types not appearing correctly
- Process template changes not taking effect as expected
- Query results not matching expected work item criteria

**Causes:**
- Process template inheritance issues or customization conflicts
- Field mapping problems in external system integrations
- Query syntax errors or field reference issues
- Cache refresh delays for process template changes
- Permission restrictions on work item access or modification

**Solutions:**
1. Validate process template inheritance and resolve customization conflicts
2. Review field mappings and synchronization settings for external integrations
3. Test work item queries with simplified criteria and validate field references
4. Allow time for cache refresh and force refresh if necessary
5. Check work item permissions and access control for affected users
