### Slide 3: Solution Overview
**layout:** visual

**DevOps Pipeline Factory Architecture**

![Architecture Diagram](assets/diagrams/architecture-diagram.png)

- **CI/CD Orchestration**
  - Azure DevOps (Repos + Pipelines) for unified source control and pipeline automation
  - Multi-stage pipelines with automated testing, security scanning, and approval workflows
- **Container & Deployment**
  - Azure Container Registry for secure image storage and vulnerability scanning
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalable container orchestration and auto-scaling
- **Security & Operations**
  - Azure Key Vault for centralized secrets management and compliance
  - Azure Monitor for comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting

---

### Slide 4: Implementation Approach
**layout:** single

**Proven Phased Methodology**

- **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
  - Azure DevOps repository setup and branching strategy
  - Design core CI/CD pipeline framework and reusable templates
  - Establish security policies and approval workflows
- **Phase 2: Build & Deploy (Weeks 5-8)**
  - Implement automated testing and security scanning
  - Deploy container registry and Kubernetes cluster
  - Configure artifact management and release orchestration
- **Phase 3: Security & Scale (Weeks 9-12)**
  - Integrate Key Vault for secrets rotation and compliance
  - Configure monitoring and alerting for production visibility
  - Enable blue-green and canary deployments for safe releases

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

*Risk Mitigation:*
- Start with single application team to validate pipeline design
- Security controls built-in from Phase 1 (not added later)
- Automated testing ensures quality gates prevent bad deployments

*Success Factors:*
- Dedicated DevOps engineer leads implementation
- Development team participation in design and validation
- Clear success metrics tied to deployment frequency and quality

*Talking Points:*
- Foundation phase delivers first automated pipeline in 2 weeks
- By week 8, entire team shipping code safely multiple times daily
- Security is automatic, not a bottleneck to deployment
