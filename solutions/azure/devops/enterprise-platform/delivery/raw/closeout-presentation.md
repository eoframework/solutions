<!-- SLIDE 5: Technical Implementation -->
# Technical Implementation

## Platform Architecture Deployed

### Core Platform Components
- Azure DevOps organization config
- Azure Container Registry (Premium)
- Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

### CI/CD Automation
- YAML pipeline templates library
- Multi-stage deployment pipelines
- Automated testing integration

- Container vulnerability scanning

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
The technical implementation delivers a comprehensive enterprise DevOps platform on Azure. The core platform includes Azure DevOps organization with Azure AD SSO integration, Azure Container Registry with Premium tier for geo-replication and vulnerability scanning, and Azure Kubernetes Service for container orchestration. The CI/CD framework includes a library of reusable YAML pipeline templates for .NET, Java, Python, and Node.js applications, multi-stage deployment pipelines with approval gates, and integrated testing automation. Security is embedded through DevSecOps with SonarCloud, WhiteSource, and Azure Security Center integration.

<!-- SLIDE 6: Deployment Architecture -->
# Deployment Architecture

## Multi-Environment Pipeline Flow

### Pipeline Stages
- Build and unit testing phase
- Security scanning integration
- Multi-environment deployment

### Deployment Strategy
- Blue-green zero-downtime deploy
- Canary release capability
- Automated rollback enabled

### Environment Management
- Development auto-deployment
- Staging with team approval
- Production with CAB approval

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
The deployment architecture implements industry best practices for enterprise software delivery. The pipeline flow progresses through build compilation and unit testing, comprehensive security scanning including SAST, DAST, and SCA, and multi-stage deployment with environment-specific configurations. The deployment strategy supports blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases, canary releases for gradual rollouts, and automated rollback capabilities when issues are detected. Environment management enforces proper governance with automatic deployment to development, team lead approval for staging, and Change Advisory Board approval for production releases.
