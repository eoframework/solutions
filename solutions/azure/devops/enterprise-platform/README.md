# DevOps Pipeline Factory

**Provider:** Azure
**Category:** DevOps
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Development teams using disparate tools and manual processes struggle with slow deployment cycles, inconsistent environments, and difficulty tracking changes across projects. Teams waste time on repetitive tasks instead of delivering features. Without standardized pipelines, errors increase and getting code to production takes too long.

This solution establishes an Azure DevOps platform with standardized CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and infrastructure-as-code templates. It provides project templates, branching strategies, and deployment workflows that teams can adopt immediately. The platform enforces quality gates, automates security scanning, and provides visibility into the entire delivery process.
