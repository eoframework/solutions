description: Secure remote desktop for modern workforce productivity
long_description: 'Remote and hybrid work requires secure access to corporate applications
  and desktops from any location. Traditional VPN solutions struggle with performance
  and user experience. Managing physical desktops or individual virtual machines for
  remote workers is expensive and difficult to scale during rapid workforce changes.


  This solution deploys Azure Virtual Desktop to provide managed Windows desktops
  and applications through the cloud. Users access their work environment from any
  device with a consistent experience. The solution handles session management, scaling
  based on demand, and integrates with existing identity systems. IT teams can quickly
  provision new users and update applications centrally.
