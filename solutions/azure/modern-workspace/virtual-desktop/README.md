# Virtual Desktop

**Provider:** Azure
**Category:** Modern Workspace
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Remote and hybrid work requires secure access to corporate applications and desktops from any location. Traditional VPN solutions struggle with performance and user experience. Managing physical desktops or individual virtual machines for remote workers is expensive and difficult to scale during rapid workforce changes.

This solution deploys Azure Virtual Desktop to provide managed Windows desktops and applications through the cloud. Users access their work environment from any device with a consistent experience. The solution handles session management, scaling based on demand, and integrates with existing identity systems. IT teams can quickly provision new users and update applications centrally.
