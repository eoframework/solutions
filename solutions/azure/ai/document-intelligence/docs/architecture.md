# Azure Document Intelligence Solution Architecture

## Overview
Comprehensive AI-powered document processing solution built on Azure Cognitive Services Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer). This solution automates document analysis, data extraction, and classification for enterprise document workflows.

## Components

### Core Azure Services
- **Azure Document Intelligence**: AI service for extracting text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents
- **Azure Storage Account**: Secure blob storage for document ingestion and processed outputs
- **Azure Key Vault**: Centralized secrets management for API keys and connection strings
- **Azure Monitor**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting for solution health
- **Azure Application Insights**: Application performance monitoring and analytics

### Processing Pipeline
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Workflow orchestration for document processing pipelines
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute for custom processing logic and transformations
- **Azure Event Grid**: Event-driven architecture for real-time document processing triggers
- **Azure Service Bus**: Reliable messaging for queue-based document processing

### Data & Analytics
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: NoSQL database for storing extracted document metadata and results
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehouse for large-scale document analytics and reporting
- **Power BI**: Business intelligence dashboards for document processing insights

```

## Data Flow

### Document Ingestion
1. Documents uploaded to Azure Storage blob containers
2. Event Grid triggers processing workflow via Logic Apps
3. Document metadata stored in Cosmos DB with processing status

### AI Processing
1. Document Intelligence analyzes documents using prebuilt or custom models
2. Extracted data validated and enriched through Azure Functions
3. Confidence scores and extraction metadata captured

### Output & Storage
1. Processed results stored in structured format (JSON/XML)
2. Original documents archived with retention policies
3. Analytics data pushed to Synapse for reporting

## Security Considerations

### Identity & Access Management
- Azure Active Directory integration for user authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permissions
- Managed identities for service-to-service authentication
- Conditional access policies for enhanced security

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.2 for all communications
- Private endpoints for network isolation
- Customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault for enhanced control

### Compliance & Governance
- Azure Policy compliance for organizational standards
- Data residency controls for regulatory requirements
- Audit logging through Azure Monitor and Security Center
- GDPR/HIPAA compliance configurations available

## Scalability

### Performance Optimization
- Auto-scaling Azure Functions based on queue depth
- Document Intelligence concurrent request limits (15 requests/second)
- Blob storage partitioning for optimal throughput
- Cosmos DB request unit (RU) scaling based on workload

### High Availability
- Multi-region deployment options for business continuity
- Zone-redundant storage for 99.99% availability SLA
- Application Gateway for load balancing and failover
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Cost Optimization
- Consumption-based pricing for serverless components
- Storage lifecycle management for automatic archiving
- Reserved capacity options for predictable workloads
- Cost monitoring and budget alerts

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- **ERP Systems**: SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics integration
- **Document Management**: SharePoint, Box, Dropbox connectors
- **Email Systems**: Outlook, Exchange attachment processing
- **Line of Business Apps**: Custom API endpoints for real-time processing

### API Endpoints
- REST APIs for document submission and status checking
- Webhooks for real-time processing notifications
- GraphQL endpoints for flexible data querying
- SDKs available for .NET, Python, JavaScript

### Data Formats
- **Input**: PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, HEIF documents
- **Output**: JSON, XML, CSV structured data formats
