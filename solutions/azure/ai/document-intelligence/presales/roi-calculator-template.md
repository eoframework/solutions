## Financial Modeling

### ROI Calculation Framework

**Return on Investment (ROI)**
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100

5-Year ROI Example:
Benefits: $15M - Investment: $2.5M = $12.5M Net Benefit
ROI = ($12.5M / $2.5M) × 100 = 500%
```

**Net Present Value (NPV)**
```
NPV = Σ [Benefits_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Where:
- Benefits_t = Benefits in year t
- r = Discount rate (typically 8-12% for technology investments)
- t = Time period (years)

Example with 10% discount rate:
Year 0: -$800K (investment)
Year 1: $1.2M / 1.1 = $1.09M
Year 2: $1.8M / 1.1² = $1.49M
Year 3: $2.2M / 1.1³ = $1.65M
Year 4: $2.5M / 1.1⁴ = $1.71M
Year 5: $2.8M / 1.1⁵ = $1.74M

NPV = -$800K + $7.68M = $6.88M
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
```
IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0

Typical AI Document Intelligence IRR range: 85-150%
```

**Payback Period**
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Average Cash Flow

Example:
$800K investment / $1.8M annual average benefit = 5.3 months
```
