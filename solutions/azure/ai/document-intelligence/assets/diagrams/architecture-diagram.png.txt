PLACEHOLDER: This file should contain the generated architecture diagram PNG.

To generate the diagram:
1. Install Python diagrams library: pip install diagrams graphviz
2. Run: python3 generate_diagram.py
3. Or use Draw.io to edit architecture-diagram.drawio and export as PNG

For now, use the Draw.io file to create the diagram manually, then export as PNG.
