⚠️ ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM PNG GENERATION NEEDED

The architecture-diagram.png file needs to be generated before regenerating presentations and documents.

OPTIONS TO CREATE THE PNG:

Option 1: Use Draw.io (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open architecture-diagram.drawio in Draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net)  
2. The diagram includes a complete Azure architecture layout
3. Replace colored rectangles with actual Azure icons from Azure stencil library
4. Export as PNG: File → Export as → PNG
5. Save as "architecture-diagram.png" in this directory

Option 2: Use Python Script
1. Install diagrams library: pip install diagrams graphviz
2. Fix import path if needed (Azure AI icons)
3. Run: python3 generate_diagram.py
4. PNG will be generated automatically

Option 3: Create Custom Diagram
1. Use your preferred diagramming tool
2. Follow the architecture in DIAGRAM_REQUIREMENTS.md
3. Export as PNG (recommended size: 1920x1080 or similar)
4. Save as "architecture-diagram.png"

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
Documents can still be generated without the PNG, but the architecture diagram will show as missing image placeholder in presentations/documents.
