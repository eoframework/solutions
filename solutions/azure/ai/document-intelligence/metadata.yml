description: Smart document processing with Azure cognitive AI
long_description: 'Businesses handle large volumes of forms and documents that require
  manual review and data entry. Processing insurance claims, loan applications, or
  customer onboarding forms ties up staff in repetitive tasks. Errors in manual processing
  lead to delays, rework, and compliance issues.


  This solution uses Azure AI Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer) to automatically
  extract data from structured and semi-structured documents. It processes forms,
  receipts, invoices, and identity documents, extracting key fields and validating
  data. The solution integrates with existing business processes and can handle high
  document volumes with consistent accuracy.
