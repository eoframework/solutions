# Azure Sentinel SIEM - Business Case

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Organizations across financial services, healthcare, government, and critical infrastructure sectors face increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats that traditional security information and event management (SIEM) systems cannot adequately address. Current challenges include:

- **Legacy SIEM Limitations**: On-premises SIEM systems with limited scalability, high operational costs, and inability to handle cloud-scale security data
- **Slow Threat Detection**: Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) of 197 days for advanced persistent threats, far exceeding acceptable risk thresholds
- **Manual Investigation Processes**: 80% of security investigations require manual effort, leading to analyst burnout and inconsistent response times
- **Compliance Gaps**: Difficulty meeting regulatory requirements for audit trails, data retention, and incident response documentation
- **Siloed Security Tools**: Lack of integration between security tools creates visibility gaps and slows threat correlation

### Proposed Solution
Azure Sentinel SIEM provides a cloud-native security information and event management platform that addresses these critical security operations challenges through:

- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Unlimited scalability with petabyte-scale data ingestion and machine learning-powered analytics
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection**: Advanced behavioral analytics that reduce MTTD from 197 days to under 5 minutes for known attack patterns
- **Automated Incident Response**: Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) capabilities that automate 80% of routine security tasks
- **Integrated Threat Intelligence**: Real-time threat intelligence integration from Microsoft's global security network and third-party feeds
- **Unified Security Operations**: Single-pane-of-glass view across cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments

### Expected Business Benefits
- **Security Operations Efficiency**: 65% reduction in manual investigation time through automated enrichment and correlation
- **Cost Optimization**: 40% reduction in total security operations costs through cloud economics and automation
- **Compliance Acceleration**: 90% reduction in audit preparation time through automated compliance reporting
- **Risk Reduction**: 85% improvement in threat detection accuracy and 70% faster incident response times
