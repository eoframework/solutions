description: Cloud SIEM for advanced threat detection & response
long_description: "Security teams face an overwhelming volume of alerts from multiple\
  \ tools\u2014firewalls, endpoints, cloud services, and applications. Analysts spend\
  \ significant time correlating events across systems, investigating false positives,\
  \ and trying to identify real threats before they cause damage. Without centralized\
  \ visibility, threats can go undetected across your environment.\n\nThis solution\
  \ implements Azure Sentinel as a cloud-based SIEM that collects security data from\
  \ across your infrastructure. It correlates events, detects anomalies using built-in\
  \ analytics rules, and provides investigation tools to respond to incidents. The\
  \ solution includes pre-configured connectors for common security tools and playbooks\
  \ for automated response.\n"
