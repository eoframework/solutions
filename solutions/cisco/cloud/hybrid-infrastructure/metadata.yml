description: Seamless hybrid cloud infrastructure integration
long_description: 'Organizations running workloads both on-premise and in the cloud
  need seamless connectivity and consistent management across environments. Managing
  separate infrastructure, security policies, and operational tools for each environment
  creates complexity and increases overhead. Applications that span both environments
  face performance and reliability challenges.


  This solution implements Cisco HyperFlex to create a unified hybrid infrastructure
  platform. It extends on-premise data center capabilities into the cloud with consistent
  networking, security, and management. The solution allows workloads to move between
  environments and provides centralized visibility and control across all infrastructure.
