description: Enterprise SD-WAN for optimized branch connectivity
long_description: 'Branch offices traditionally require expensive MPLS circuits for
  connectivity to headquarters and cloud services. Managing individual configurations
  for each branch is time-consuming, and changes require site visits or complex remote
  procedures. Users experience poor performance when accessing cloud applications
  over backhauled connections through the data center.


  This solution deploys Cisco SD-WAN to connect branch offices using multiple internet
  connections instead of costly MPLS. It automatically routes traffic based on application
  requirements and network conditions, providing better performance and reliability.
  The solution centralizes management, allows policy changes across all branches simultaneously,
  and improves cloud application access with direct internet breakout.
