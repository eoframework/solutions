<!-- SLIDE 3: Solution Architecture - eo_visual_content layout -->

## Solution Architecture

### SD-WAN Fabric Architecture

<!-- eo_visual_content -->
<!-- visual: architecture diagram showing vManage, vBond, vSmart, vEdge deployment -->

#### Management Plane
- Cisco vManage orchestration
- Centralized policy management
- Real-time analytics dashboard

#### Control Plane
- Cisco vSmart controllers (HA)
- Secure control connections
- Policy distribution engine

#### Data Plane
- Cisco vEdge routers (150 sites)
- IPsec overlay tunnels
- Application-aware routing

::: speaker-notes
Our SD-WAN architecture uses Cisco vManage for orchestration, vSmart controllers for policy distribution, and vEdge routers at 150 sites for application-aware routing over secure IPsec tunnels.
