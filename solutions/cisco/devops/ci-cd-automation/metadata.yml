description: Network-aware CI/CD for infrastructure automation
long_description: 'Network infrastructure changes often require manual configuration
  across multiple devices, leading to errors and slow deployment cycles. Teams struggle
  to track changes, roll back problematic updates, and maintain consistency across
  environments. Testing network changes in production is risky, but building separate
  test environments is expensive.


  This solution brings DevOps practices to network infrastructure using Cisco automation
  tools. It enables infrastructure-as-code for network configurations, automated testing
  of changes, and version-controlled network policies. Teams can deploy network changes
  through CI/CD pipelines with approval workflows, automated validation, and easy
  rollback capabilities.
