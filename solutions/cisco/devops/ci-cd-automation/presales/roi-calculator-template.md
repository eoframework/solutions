## ROI Calculation Framework

### ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Net Benefits - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100%

Where:
- Net Benefits = Total Benefits - Total Costs over analysis period
- Total Investment = Initial investment + ongoing costs
- Analysis Period = Typically 3-5 years
```

### Key Financial Metrics
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Present value of future cash flows minus initial investment
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Rate that makes NPV equal zero
- **Payback Period**: Time required to recover initial investment
- **Break-Even Point**: When cumulative benefits equal cumulative costs
