# SLIDE 7: Zero Trust Architecture

## Never Trust, Always Verify

### Traditional Perimeter vs. Zero Trust

#### Traditional "Castle and Moat" Model
```
Internet ──→ Firewall ──→ [TRUSTED INTERNAL NETWORK] ──→ Resources
              ↑                   ↑
          Single Point         Implicit Trust
          of Defense          Once Inside
```

#### Cisco Zero Trust Model
```
    User/Device ──→ Identity Verification ──→ Risk Assessment ──→ Policy Decision
         ↓                    ↓                      ↓               ↓
    Continuous              Device                Context           Least Privilege
    Verification            Compliance            Analysis          Access
```

### Zero Trust Principles
1. **Verify Explicitly**: Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
2. **Use Least Privileged Access**: Minimize user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access
3. **Assume Breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access

### Business Benefits
- **81% reduction** in data breach costs with Zero Trust
- **73% improvement** in security incident response time  
- **65% increase** in user productivity through seamless access
- **50% reduction** in compliance audit findings
