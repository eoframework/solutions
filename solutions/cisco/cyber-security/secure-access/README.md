# Zero Trust Network Gateway

**Provider:** Cisco
**Category:** Cyber Security
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** In Review

## Solution Description

Traditional network security assumes users inside the network perimeter are trusted, but remote work and cloud applications have eliminated clear perimeters. Users access applications from various devices and locations, making it difficult to verify identity and enforce security policies. Breaches often occur when attackers gain initial access and move laterally through the network.

This solution implements zero-trust network access using Cisco security technologies. It verifies every access request regardless of location, enforces least-privilege access, and continuously validates user and device trust. The solution provides secure access to applications without exposing the entire network and logs all access for compliance and investigation.
