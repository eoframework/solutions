## Solution Architecture

### Zero Trust Security Platform

<!-- eo_visual_content -->
<!-- visual: architecture diagram showing Duo, Umbrella, ISE, AnyConnect, SecureX integration -->

#### Identity & Access
- Cisco Duo multi-factor authentication
- Adaptive risk-based policies
- Device trust verification

#### Network Security
- Cisco Umbrella DNS protection
- Cisco ISE network access control
- Micro-segmentation policies

#### Endpoint Protection
- Cisco AnyConnect secure client
- Endpoint posture assessment
- Continuous compliance checks

::: speaker-notes
Our zero trust architecture integrates five Cisco platforms: Duo for identity verification, Umbrella for DNS security, ISE for network access control, AnyConnect for endpoint connectivity, and SecureX for unified orchestration.
