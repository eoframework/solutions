description: Zero-trust network access for enhanced security
long_description: 'Traditional network security assumes users inside the network perimeter
  are trusted, but remote work and cloud applications have eliminated clear perimeters.
  Users access applications from various devices and locations, making it difficult
  to verify identity and enforce security policies. Breaches often occur when attackers
  gain initial access and move laterally through the network.


  This solution implements zero-trust network access using Cisco security technologies.
  It verifies every access request regardless of location, enforces least-privilege
  access, and continuously validates user and device trust. The solution provides
  secure access to applications without exposing the entire network and logs all access
  for compliance and investigation.
